Levi S. Gibbs,Regional Identity in Modern Chinese Literature ,"How do writers, performers, poets, and filmmakers mediate between particular localities, neighboring regions, and broader notions of Chineseness in their representations of Chinese regional identities? And how do the emerging conversations shed light on changing relationships between region and capital, the local and national, and North and South China? Looking at poems, ballads, novels, films, and TV dramas from diverse regions across China and beyond in light of recent studies of regional representation, poetics, eco-literature, and the role of language and dialect in identity formation, this panel explores insider and outsider views of place and what happens when regions transgress borders. The panelists examine how nineteenth century drum ballads formed a literary geography of North China that shifted from a sense of belonging in a unified world of empire to an emphasis on the local, how borderland poets from southwest China and North-East India use imagery and themes of cultural and ecological change to convey new senses of being, place, and identity, how educated urban narrators in interactions between Putonghua-speaking sent-down youth and dialect-speaking locals negotiate local languages in contemporary film and fiction, and how gendered representations of northern Shaanxi men and women in recent novels and TV dramas serve as discursive sites for broader discussions of cultural exchange and rebirth in China. In each case, the changing depictions of the familiar and unfamiliar suggest evolving senses of place and identity during Chinas recent history. "
Ingrid Yeung,Ritual Design in China ,"Transdisciplinary discussions on ritual from the angles of performativity, visuality, and materiality have continued to renew the subject of study over the past two to three decades. Some of the key questions raised have yet to be fully addressed in the study of rituals in China. How is ritual a performative practice? When vision is understood as socially constructed, how does it change the way we think about ritual display? What roles do materials play in ritual? This panel reframes these and other issues - the making of self-identities, exertion of authority, and maintenance of social order - as ritual design. Examining diverse source materials that range from Yinxu oracle bones and grave goods, early Chinese discussions of clothing and textiles, Kitan ceremonial attire, and Yuan court ceramics, this panel asks how the study of ritual objects, their material qualities, and their functions in the production of ritual acts, can be enriched by the conceptual framework of ritual design. Our format of inquiry, which is discussion-based and workshop-style, departs from the orthodox paper presentation model. Participants will first provide a short description of their source material and concisely address the question, what is ritual design in China? The panelists will then comment on each others pre-circulated work-in-progress papers and discuss the value of ritual design as a methodological approach. "
Christian P. Sorace,Wenchuan Earthquake: A Decade of Changes and Continuities ,"This roundtable marks the 10-year anniversary of the biggest disaster in Chinas recent history, the Wenchuan Earthquake, which transformed state-society relations, crisis management and ideology work. In the immediate post-quake aftermath, the unprecedented outpouring of social compassion, volunteerism, rise of NGOs and open media coverage appeared to mark the long anticipated emergence of civil society in China. These brief intervals of possibility flickered out as the Party-state embarked on a top-down process of reconstruction, moral performance, and legitimation. The state at once exhibited responsiveness and deployed its repressive apparatus to silence grieving parents whose children were crushed underneath shoddily-constructed tofu-dreg schoolhouses, and to censor the media. To this day, the Wenchuan disaster remains a sensitive subject to investigate. Our panelists will discuss, from a variety of disciplinary and methodological perspectives, the different Chinas that emerged, and were buried, during the earthquake and its aftermath, distilling the shifts and continuities in Chinas modes of governance and state-society dynamics. As a former NPR correspondent during the Wenchuan earthquake, our chair, Louisa Lim, is uniquely positioned to moderate the roundtable. All the other participants will draw from their recent books, entirely or partially devoted to the study of the disaster. Christian Sorace will discuss the earthquake from the perspective of the Communist Partys legitimation strategies and concern with image-building. Kang Yi will trace the development trajectory of different types of non-governmental organizations and discuss the fluid NGO-state relationship during the eight years after the earthquake. Bin Xu will discuss how the earthquake revealed both the strength and weakness of ordinary Chinese citizens volunteering under an authoritarian state and how the disaster has been remembered and forgotten in political and cultural practices. Maria Repnikova will explain how the earthquake served at once as a turning point for media-state relations and as a dramatic example of the contradictions in states crisis management that ensue to this day. Everett Zhang will discuss how survivors resentment regarding the deaths of school children was informed by and reinforced a different sense of natural disaster and justice in China from that present in the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake.  "
Uganda Sze Pui Kwan,"Collaboration, Competition and Intelligentsia Circle for a New China Horizon ","Intellectual ideas are never produced in a vacuum. It emerges from debates, collaboratively or contestably, across cultures and continents. This panel explores the formation of intelligentsia circles that takes the form of both cooperation and competition with their intellectual other, whereby new linguistic dispositions, conceptual apparatus, and modes of explicating patterns are formed. Four papers echo on the concept of shared horizon, expounded by Peter Gordon, while focusing on the different possible content of the proposition What is China, in relation to the framework of traditional Sinology and modern Chinese studies. DesForgess paper studies the Qing academics who downplayed the instrumental purpose of the civil examination system to inquire into an analytical understanding of the systems inner strength. The format of these inquiries was as radical as those produced by the learned societies in Europe. Saarelas paper explores the dialectical vision reflected through a group of European Sinological grammaticians on deciphering the Manchu language in the academic arena. The paper concludes that this effort has finally taken stride when individual animosity was discarded. Kwan discusses the hostility conjured during the race of understanding China by the British and the French imperial interpreters in the nineteenth century. Using the firsthand experiences with the local Chinese people, the British shaped a new phase of Chinese studies in Anglophone world.  Chen argues for a subtle collaboration of appropriating the Athenian legacy by both sides of Chinas 1920s cultural war, which underlined rediscovery and reincarnation of classical Chinese heritage in Chinas post-classical age. "
Suyoung Son,Chinese Practices of Intellectual Property ,"The rampant imitation, counterfeiting, and falsification of goods in contemporary China have led to vehement debates over understandings of intellectual property. On the one hand, China has been condemned for failing to guarantee the protections like Western copyright law has done; on the other hand, Chinese culture has been excused for privileging tradition over creativity and communal possession over individual rights. While these two positions appear to be at odds, they proceed from the same assumption: that China did not have an indigenous concept of intellectual property before the arrival of modern international law from the West at the beginning of the twentieth century. Challenging this predominant view, this panel explores concepts and practices related to intellectual property that have emerged along with the rapid expansion of the market from the sixteenth to the early twentieth centuries. Integrating textual, visual, and material evidence, the panelists explore the formation of trademarks and copyrights, examining how these practices were mediated through inscriptions, portraits of the publisher, silk loom-marks, and seals and stamps. As a starting point to discuss hitherto unexplored Chinese practices of intellectual property, this panel aims to move beyond merely adding non-Western materials. It will also shed light on the historical contingencies behind the development of modern intellectual property by reexamining far-reaching contests over originality and authenticity, authorship and craft, and the shifting values assigned to words and things in pre-twentieth century China. "
Jerome Doyon,Political Socialization of Elite Chinese Students: A Trans-disciplinary Approach ,"How do the party and state institutions in the surviving communist systems manage to attract young and educated recruits and guarantee their lifelong commitment to a political career? This question is particularly relevant in investigating evolving communist systems, such as post-Mao China, where revolutionary ideology no longer functions as a key structuring element and where a liberalized employment market provides ambitious young individuals with many attractive career options beyond the party-state bureaucracy. This panel tackles this question by looking at various forms of political socialization for Chinese students. From the high school to the end of graduate studies, we unveil various mechanisms which transform students perceptions of their professional paths, influence their trajectories, and eventually cultivate their commitment to a career in the party-state. Each of the four papers investigates various mechanisms and hierarchies within school systems in which students are incorporated, including the Party organizations in high schools and universities, as well as its youth organizations, which maintain a management monopoly over students extracurricular activities in schools. Because our central interest is in elite renewal, the papers focus mainly on the countrys best high schools and universities, which provide the most cadres to the Party-State. The papers methods vary from experimental research to ethnographic observation, and their analytical approaches range from the sociology of education to the study of informal political ties. Thus, while they all treat the issue of political socialization, they offer a diversity of perspectives. "
Jonathan K. Skaff,Slaves And/or Servants: Human Bondage in Chinas States and Societies over the ,"This panel examines the role of slavery in Chinese history, a generally neglected topic. Lack of scholarship on human bondage, as Robin Yates has noted previously, has led China to be overlooked in the burgeoning field of slavery in world history. Yates begins the panel by considering recently unearthed legal and administrative documents of the Qin and Han dynasties. His paper grapples with challenges of definition, particularly distinguishing between slaves, servants, and other low-status individuals in private households and state service. Jonathan Skaff also utilizes excavated sources, Tang Dynasty slave contracts and travel permits. The latter mention slaves, servants, and other Silk Road travelers. He finds that slaves of foreign and domestic origin supplied the majority of labor to elite Tang households and supplemented the profits of Inner Asian merchants. Like Skaff, Don Wyatts paper reveals that slavery in China was entangled with practices of greater Eurasia. The victorious Jurchen Jin army profited from the enslavement of the defeated Northern Song populace in 1127. Moreover, during the Mongol Empire, Turk warriors and Korean females were trafficked over long distances. Johanna Ransmeiers paper on the late Qing and early Republican periods argues that lines between slaves, servants and wives all outsiders who were integrated into households contractually were unclear. This underlying problem, together with Marxist approaches to Chinese history, served to obscure the persistence of slavery and need for emancipation into the twentieth-century. Finally, the discussant, Pamela Crossley, who also has engaged in research on slavery, will offer her insights. "
David J. Lebovitz,Reevaluating the Coalescence and Evolution of Chinese Verse Forms ,"This panel will diachronically explore the processes by which Chinese verse forms coalesce and evolve. It will shed light on the material, compositional, and critical practices that underlie the evolution of rhyming verse in China, and reevaluate the bounds of poetry and literature as these terms translate Chinese textual forms. While one may consider shi, fu, or other categories of rhyming verse as bounded or implicitly static categories, at least two recent developments in the field have begun to erode this assumption: first, rhyming verse texts have been newly discovered in manuscripts that defy both thematic norms and bibliographic schemes of classification; second, meta-critical perspectives that examine processes of composition, critique, compilation, imitation, and forgery have revealed both the emergence of genres and deflections in the prototypical theme, topic or form of readily identified genres. The panel seeks to employ these new sources and methodological perspectives to rethink the history of Chinese versification. David Lebovitz (University of Chicago) will employ manuscript sources to explore the problems of categorizing verse forms prior to Han bibliographies; Thomas Mazanec (UC Santa Barbara) will investigate the coherence of early medieval zan around an anti-lyrical poetics of exteriority; Su Fu (Princeton) will probe the redefinition of the sao genre in critical readings of the Song dynasty; and Feiran Du (Harvard) will discuss the boundaries between poetry and prose in Song criticism. David Schaberg (UCLA) will serve as discussant and Paul W. Kroll (University of Colorado, Boulder) will chair the panel. "
Shaohua Guo,Of Performativity and Parody: Cultural Politics in Contemporary China ,"This four-speaker panel investigates the political ramifications of studying Chinese popular culture as it travels across geographical boundaries and academic disciplines. Through an analysis of four performance genres - online videos, experimental theater, film, and television series - this panel seeks to expand the current understanding of cultural politics in contemporary China. Taking, as a case study, Papi Jiang, Chinas most popular Internet celebrity in 2016, Jie Zhang delineates the ways in which Papi Jiangs shrewd appropriation of media conventions contributes to the viral dissemination of her self-made videos. Delving into Meng Jinghuis use of metatheater over a span of two decades, Hongjian Wang provides new analytical angles from which to explicate Mengs controversial transition from an avant-garde director to one catering to the mainstream market. By analyzing the transmutations of male bodies in the series A Chinese Odyssey (1995-2015), Jun Lei demonstrates how a gendered approach to Stephen Chows movies sheds new light on understanding identity politics in Hong Kong. Finally, Shaohua Guo examines Fated to Love You (2008), one of the most popular Taiwanese idol dramas, and argues that the dramas trans-regional appeal is largely attributable to its calculated endeavor to mediate geopolitical relations among Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China.    All four studies address how performativity and parody are appropriated in diverse media spaces, while highlighting the intricate interplay of media conventions, technological affordances, and collective and individual actors in jointly shaping the cultural dynamics in contemporary China.  "
Timothy Clifford,Literary Anthologies and Information Management in Imperial China ,"In China, literary anthologies have long mediated between what Margaret Cohen and Franco Morretti have called the great unread and its canonical fraction. Despite this key role, however, anthologies have not received as much scholarly attention as they deserve. The most well-known have been viewed as too facile and derivative to merit serious study, and the less well-known have defied traditional methods of textual scholarship by virtue of their sheer quantity. Drawing inspiration from the field of information management, our panel conceptualizes the anthologys function in terms of compressing, ordering, and regulating readers access to literary documents, and explores how this function reflected and structured new understandings of literature and literary history. Tians paper traces a long-term shift in how anthologies arranged their selections, describing the breakdown of older classification systems and the new notion of literature that emerged. Chens paper dives into a mass of now forgotten ancient-style poetry anthologies produced in the late imperial period, mapping their citation practices and proposing a new method for measuring the impact of individual anthologies. Patterson and Clifford, in contrast, focus on two famous and still widely used anthologies, comparing them with their competitors and delineating the arguments implicit in their purportedly neutral mode of simplification. Our papers range across historical periods and move comfortably between multiple scales of analysis. Together, we initiate a conversation on the role of anthologies which might be productively expanded to a broader East Asian context, and which speaks to a digital turn in recent literary scholarship. "
Kun Qian,Unreconciled Memories:  Oral Histories of the Cultural Revolution ,"It has been over half a century since the launch of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) in China and people who have experienced it are now aged and aging, yet no consensus has been reached about its origin, consequences, and aftermath. Instead, nostalgia and amnesia in contemporary China threaten to bury the truth of this notorious historical event. Responding to the urgency of saving memories, the East Asian Library at the University of Pittsburgh launched a CR/10 (Cultural Revolution/10 minutes) Project in late 2016, collecting short interviews of people from different ages, professions, family backgrounds, and geographical locations that bring to light a multitude of narratives and perspectives about the memories of the Cultural Revolution. The ongoing CR/10 project is the first digital archive on the subject that will be used for teaching and research. This innovative and interdisciplinary roundtable will revolve around the screening of selected CR/10 interviews, followed by discussions among scholars in history, literature, sociology, and information science regarding the crystalline memories of the Cultural Revolution. Discussants have begun receiving recordings of the interviews, while subtitling in English and editing proceed. Discussants will bring their own expertise to comment on the significance of the CR/10 project in particular, and oral history in general. For instance, Rongqian Ma (Library) will demonstrate how the digital archive in the library will help teaching and research and preserve memories of the Cultural Revolution; Paul Pickowicz (History) will incorporate his own filmed interviews on the subject to question the simplified victimization narrative and class-based interpretation to uncover the complex nature of his historical event; and Guobin Yang (Sociology) will discuss how the CR/10 project sheds light on the meanings of revolutionary tradition and political culture for the Cultural Revolution generation as well as the powerful influences of this political culture on their behavior in the Red Guard movement. As a whole, this roundtable discussion will address the crisis of memory and explore various perspectives, methodologies, and ways of collaborating to deal with controversial histories such as that of the Cultural Revolution.  "
Emily Mokros,Rereading Qing History Through Diaries ,"How do we read and use diaries as historical sources? Recent publishing and database projects in China have created accessibility to diaries of both notables and relative unknowns. But even as diaries suggest tantalizing access to secret conversations and hidden motivations, they overwhelm with social complexities, coded language, and mundane routines. The papers on this panel consider late Qing diaries in light of governance, rebellion, diplomacy, and reform. As the papers demonstrate, diarists involved with official bureaucracies and projects had diverse personal, emotional, and official motivations for keeping daily records. Bingyu Zheng will explore ethnicity and urban space through the descriptions of daily life, routines and relationships in the diary of an adopted bannerman in nineteenth-century Beijing. Emily Mokros will consider the information-gathering techniques and emotional allegiances of a low-level capital official during the ravages of the mid-nineteenth-century rebellions. Jenny Huangfu Day will focus on global and domestic influences in late Qing envoy reports, reflecting transition away from the travelogues distinctive of early Qing envoys. Ke Ren will read a late Qing scholarly diary to map the intersections between political and publishing circles centered in Nanjing. Andrea S. Goldman, who has used diaries extensively in her work on Qing urban culture and politics, will comment on the papers. In addition to generating a conversation about how personal voices connect to overarching political narratives, each panelist will foreground primary sources by describing reading strategies and the limitations and advantages of diaristic sources. "
Di Luo,Beyond Literacy: Womens Pluralistic Approach to Cultural and Political ,"Womens liberation was at the core of the modernization agenda of twentieth-century Chinese reformists, revolutionaries, and social activists, within which female literacy was highly emphasized and has figured prominently in modern Chinese historiography. How women navigated the changing social environment and defined themselves is a question requiring further study. Drawing papers from the fields of History, Art History, Performance Studies, and Film Studies, this panel suggests that women oftentimes mobilized more diverse means oral, aural, visual, bodily, and cinematic to engage culture and politics and thus configure the image and ethics of woman in a vibrant and constantly changing way. Focusing on rural womens literacy learning experiences in 1930s and 1940s north China, our first paper suggests that even in the classroom setting, oral and aural experiences played a crucial role in womens self-making process, in addition to reading and writing. Our second paper examines visual representations that pertained to post-1949 literacy campaigns in China. Images of women teaching and learning, which circulated as propaganda posters, contributed to the redefinition of aesthetic tastes and womens virtue in socialist China. Our third paper questions the power of literacy from a bodily perspective by uncovering the dynamic social choreography of the mass dance movement from 1958 to 1960. Through a cinematic lens, our last paper concludes this panel by examining how a female director used multimedia approaches to express herself and explore the politics of space and its relationship to the representation of women in post-1978 China within the context of globalization. "
Jane Duckett,New Directions in Research on Policy Making in China ,"Research on policy making in China has grown, particularly since the turn of the 21st century. As a result, we now know more about the role bureaucratic actors in designing and formulating policy, as well as the increased influence of non-state actors in some policy spheres and their ability to get ideas on the policy agenda. Our panel further advances understanding by introducing new methods, data and conceptual frameworks that together show the possibilities for a more dynamic understanding of policy making, elite policy coordination, and the limited impacts of new, more inclusive policy agendas. Duckett incorporates dynamic network analysis into an examination of how health policy ideas and networks have evolved over time. Huhe and Stepan analyse a large dataset on leading small groups (LSGs) to explore intra-elite networks and coordinating mechanisms. Zhu, Xiao and Ding explore improved portrayals of marginalised groups in policy and media circles and the obstacles to translating them into meaningful programmatic change. Together the papers form a panel that opens up new directions in research on policy making in China - directions that are better able to show evolving policy networks and endogenous policy change, track interactions among elite policy makers and coordination and across policy areas; and show the obstacles to meaningful social policy implementation. "
Carlos  Rojas,Sex and Sexuality in Greater China and Inner Asia ,"Coming soon "
Nancy Steinhardt,Overturning Old Ideas About Yuan Architecture ,"The four papers of this panel explore how longstanding ideas about Yuan architecture, and thereby China under Mongol rule, can be overturned by 21st century discoveries, methodologies, and perspectives. The first two papers examine Yuan tombs that have become known in recent years. Steinhardt argues that despite the burial goods that point to a Chinese tomb occupant, the brick, dome-on-square structure and location identify a tomb as Muslim and for Yuan-period royalty. With a focus on actual burial structure and painted or carved building motifs, Lins paper reconsiders how a presumably enclosed and cohesive burial space was deconstructed in the Yuan period, and he then explains what a different conception of tombs the new construction reveals. Zuo turns to anthropological studies of contemporary vernacular timber architecture and exposes a technological regression that existed in Yuan architecture due, she argues, to social and economic causes. Yu investigates Xia Yong, a painter who takes architecture as his subjects and turns buildings into two-dimensional representations, to show how a Yuan artist redefined Song-period representations of architecture. This panel intentionally chooses four kinds of architecture the brick structure, underground burial, timber-frame structure, and representations on silk to explore the topic in the widest possible way. By challenging generally accepted views of these four manifestations of Yuan architecture, we seek to pose and suggest answers for questions about art, architecture and craftsmanship during the Yuan dynasty. "

Anatoly Detwyler,"Data Past, Data Present: Chinese Narratives Of/as Information History ","From the digitization of collections, to the development of computational tools for document markup and statistical analysis, new forms of data-centered research are expanding the ways in which scholars engage with texts. Crucial to the rise of the so-called digital humanities is the task of datafication the extraction of morselized information from a document and its aggregation into larger sets a process that underlies empirical analysis and visual summary, producing not only new historical and literary knowledge but even new ways of knowing altogether. This panel seeks to both showcase and historicize data in China studies in order to explore the intersections between the datafication of the past and the past of datafication: What can late imperial bureaucratic conventions of embedding citational data tell us about the formal tensions between linear narrative and nonlinear dataframe (Wang)? When did textual datafication become a historiographic tool, and how did it produce accounts of its own technologies and impulses (Detwyler)? What is the more recent history of computational humanities in China, and what are its connections to and differences with the rise of digital humanities in the West (Chen)? How can digitized corpora help us identify patterns in premodern textual practices of citation itself a latent form of data management in Chinese writing (Sturgeon)? Ranging from the pre-Qin to the present, these diverse case studies collectively provide an opportunity to critically locate data as a subject and method within the study of Chinese history. "
Yidi Wu,History and Memory in the PRC: Competing Narratives of the Anti-Rightist ,"Writing memoirs of the Maoist era can be a challenge to the Chinese state control of historical narratives, especially with the increasing suppression of dissent under Xi Jinping. Nevertheless, those who wish to recall pasts diverging from the orthodox have remained resilient and innovative in their efforts. How should we understand these beneath the radar works? This panel, taking the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957-58 as a case study, discusses four facets of this interplay between history and memory. We present narratives from across the ideological spectrum that compete not only against the state, but with each other. Though memory is self-serving and therefore unreliable in restoring history, we explore memoirs as a discourse and for the positions taken by their writers. Dayton Lekner traces the ongoing struggle between Party loyalists and those labeled Rightist for appropriation and control of the key imagery, and associated memories, of the campaign. Yidi Wu explores changing perceptions of the label Rightist itself - from being marginalized and punished to taking pride and becoming dissidents. William Sima explores the biographies of three victims of the campaign as both a way of challenging Party lore and ideology, and as problematic in their return to the tradition of biography as history. Last, Anja Blanke investigates the interplay of competing narratives among memoirs written by survivors of the campaign. Overall, our panel contributes to a better understanding of the corpus of unofficial writing surrounding the Anti-Rightist Campaign and asks what place history, and historiography, might afford these works. "
Ethan Michelson,Advances in Understanding Chinese Court Behavior ,"New Supreme Peoples Court (SPC) rules which took effect in the beginning of 2014 requiring every court at every level to publish every decision online (with some exceptions, and as part of broader online government transparency initiatives) introduce the tantalizing possibility of revolutionizing the study of Chinese court behavior. At the present time, almost everything we know about Chinese courts comes from the qualitative analysis of interview and ethnographic data and the quantitative analysis of small samples of manually coded court decisions. The public accessibility of tens of millions of written court decisions necessitates radically different strategies of data collection, management, and analysis. The papers in this panel represent path-breaking efforts to chart this new research frontier by showcasing innovative analytical techniques, fresh empirical findings, and cautionary lessons about data bias. The papers in this panel also collectively embody the ideals of diversity championed by the AAS in terms of discipline, rank, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and methodology. Liebmans paper, drawing on over one million court decisions from Henan Province, is intended as a primer on the use and misuse of online court decisions. Michelsons analysis of the same court decisions from Henan reveals discrimination against women on a massive scale in the context of divorce litigation. Lis paper, also on divorce litigation, reveals the nature and extent of important discrepancies between the language of courts in action and the language of published decisions. Finally, Smith tackles the issue of bias in the selective publication of SPC death penalty review decisions. "
Jeffrey Wasserstrom,China and the World in 1900: Comparative Perspectives ,"1900 was a dramatic year for China, due to such events as the the fifty-five day siege of Beijing laid by anti-Christian militants known as Boxers and Qing Dynasty troops, and the international invasion by an Allied Army with soldiers from eight countries.  This panel will ask how new light can be shed on these actions by paying attention to comparisons, some of which move across space, others across time.  In 1900, many participants and observers thought of Chinese events as related to or entwined with conflicts underway in other places (e.g., the Tagalog Rebellion), and there was much talk as well about echoes of the past (e.g., Britons often likened the siege of Beijing to one that took place during the 1857 Mutiny).  After 1900, moreover, analogies have been drawn between the Boxers and other groups, including the Red Guards.  Each participant in this panel will bring up comparisons that move between countries, periods, or both.  The format will be innovative in that the panel will be divided into three parts.  In the first, geographical comparisons will be central.  Xu will give a short presentation that moves between China and the United States and Sebring will give one on contrasting visual works produced in Asia and the West in 1900.  After their presentations both no more than ten minutes there will be twenty minutes for discussion among all panelists and give and take with the audience. The second third will concentrate on chronological comparisons, with Wasserstrom exploring ways that the Chinese crisis could generate a sense of deja  vu, while Bickers looks at later events that can be seen as replays of sorts of things that happened in 1900.  Again, the presentations will be short, the time for discussion extended.  The final third will have no presentations just discussion.  To start it, though, Meyer-Fong, a specialist in earlier periods, and Mitter, who has worked most on World War II, will give short comments that reflect on the comparisons raised up to that point and perhaps suggest further ones. "
Anne H. Reinhardt,"Approaches to Economic Reconstruction in China, 1930s-1950s ","The three decades of the 1930s-1950s were a time of intensive change in China, as the Japanese invasion was followed by the civil war and the Communist victory in 1949.  War and political transitions serve as conventional boundaries of historical periodization, but such boundaries can be interrogated and challenged by identifying the underlying structures and continuous views that run through them.  Focusing on industrial organizations, this panel investigates approaches to economic reconstruction dating from the pre-war or wartime periods that persisted through the tumultuous years that followed.  The panel presents three types of industrial organization: low-level local industrial cooperatives, a leading shipping company with a national reach, and the largest state-owned manufacturer of iron and steel.  All three originated in the pre-war or wartime period and navigated the political transitions of the postwar in pursuit of their visions of a stable and independent China.  Together, these archive-based studies argue for the resilience and continuity of economic ideas, management models, and above all, shared priorities for reconstruction that emerged from the wartime period and appealed across the political spectrum in subsequent years. "
Luke Habberstad,Law in Early Imperial China: Interpretation and Transformation ,"The discovery of thousands of legal and administrative manuscripts, along with careful re-readings of transmitted texts, has allowed scholars to reconstruct the legal institutions of Chinas early imperial period (221 BCE-220 CE) in unprecedented detail. As all students of early Chinese law readily admit, however, recovered statutes and ordinances themselves tell us little about legal praxis. The study of legal interpretation has thus largely been confined to high-level decisions and the use of the Classics in Han jurisprudence. Correspondingly, it can be difficult to set aside statist assumptions of law as a strategy of social control when we focus on areas beyond the most elite levels of the imperial court. This panel attempts to do precisely that, however, by asking two questions: 1) How does our picture of early imperial law change when we assume that laws were not just instruments of control but also sites for interpretation? 2) How was legal meaning transformed as statutes, edicts, problematic cases, precedents, and petitions were transmitted across social and spatial divisions? Each panelist will address these questions through analysis of sources that reflect the dynamics of legal interpretation and transformation at distinct social levels and geographic areas, from local counties and commanderies to regional kingdoms to the imperial court. Rather than the traditional format of successive presentations, the chair will discuss larger trends in the field of early legal history, followed by shortened and collaborative presentations of key findings, concluding with a response from the discussant designed to elicit wider audience participation. "
Xiaolu Ma,Reconfiguring the Past: Religio-Philosophical Inquiry in Modern Chinese Literature ,"This panel integrates historical, literary, religious and philosophical inquiry to examine how modern and contemporary Chinese intellectuals interweave a wide spectrum of Eastern and Western religio-philosophical traditions into their creative writing and translation. As scholarly consensus has it, the introduction of Western intellectual history into China in the twentieth century provided an impetus towards ideological modernization; in this process of self-rejuvenation, the dialectical relationship between Western culture and Asian tradition compelled Chinese intellectuals to reconfigure their cultural legacy while appropriating Western thought. Drawing into discussion several religio-philosophical traditions (specifically wu-shamanism, Tibetan Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity), this panel takes a comparative perspective on four key episodes, spanning the period from the late Qing era to the contemporary period, in which writers linked Chinese and Western literature and religion/philosophy. Shuyang Pan examines the reconstruction of literary wu-shamanism by two Chinese writers, Xiao Hong (1911-1942) and Duanmu Hongliang (1912-1996), as they confront the conflict between the primitive and the modern. Xiaolu Ma explores the early twentieth century Chinese transculturation and secularization of Tolstoyism, with its deep roots in Russian Orthodox Christianity and Asian Taoism and Buddhism. Jianmei Liu interrogates the connection between the Zen Buddhist comprehension of Dao and the representation of women in Nobel laureate Gao Xingjians novels and plays. Finally, Thomas Moran investigates the intersection of Western philosophy and Tibetan Buddhism in a study of the representation of human consciousness in Ning Kens 2010 novel Tian Â· Zang. "
Regina Llamas,"An Archeology of the Popular: Renegotiating Language, Point of View, and Authority ","Profound shifts in the popularity and status of drama as well as the literary uses of vernacular language, fictional portrayal, and humor have garnered much attention in recent studies of late imperial Chinese theater (1550-1911).  Less well understood are the roots of these transformations in works from earlier periods.  Centering on readings of discourses associated with theater and song during middle period China (1115-1550), this panel explores the expanding use of colloquial language and the embrace of a broader social range of figures such as actors, peasants, and diasporic authors in writings from the Yuan and Ming. The papers seek to engage with the following questions: Do these works reflect a spoken language of any sort, or are they inventing a new literary standard that makes use of colloquial elements? Do they introduce new points of view only to dismiss them as comic fodder for a literary elite or do they empower outsiders? Do the new forms of humor reinforce the existing literary socio-hierarchies, or do they challenge cultural authority? Is the meaning of acting on stage a form of didactic suasion, an incantatory and illusionistic invocation of historical paragons, and/or a platform for the virtuoso display of vocal, verbal, and comic skills?  Taken together, the papers in this panel reveal how shifting language registers, points of view, and a new found authority of humor challenged conventional standards of literary expression, thus paving the way for new literati norms and attitudes vis-a-vis performance-related forms in the late Ming. "
Yuyu (Lara)  Yang,"Two-part Panel:Knowledge Production, Reading Practice, and Meaning Making in ","During the first two decades of the Peoples Republic, publishing companies, cultural agencies, and party organs adopted and adapted the productive technologies and organizational systems of the prior capitalist publishing system to serve the needs of state socialism. This panel explores previously unexamined dynamics of socialist cultural production during the Mao era to complicate our understanding of that process. Lius and Culps papers focus on how new agents of production, respectively the Womens Federation and a consortium of publishing companies under the Ministry of Culture, generated new periodicals and series publications. In turn, Lu and Yang concentrate on very material processes of book production by illuminating how paper was supplied to print Maos Little Red Book and the resurgent technology of archaic woodblock printing was used to make books for connoisseurs. In combination, the papers demonstrate the diverse ways cultural producers appropriated existing technologies and organizational systems, or invented new ones, to express their messages. These various agents and approaches to textual production developed even as the Chinese Communist Party sought to centralize control of the publishing industry in unprecedented ways. Yet the papers also suggest how genres of text ranging from journals, classics, and series to the Little Red Book were subject to party governance even as they contributed to its development in various ways. For both of these coordinated panels, the chairs will provide brief framing comments. For panel I, the chair and discussant will each comment for ten minutes at the end of the paper presentations. "
Ying Jia Tan,Manufacturing the Metropolis in Modern and Contemporary China ,"Chinas metropolitan areas have experienced phenomenal growth in recent decades. This panel examines how industries reshaped socio-spatial dimensions of mega-cities in modern and contemporary China. Moving beyond the modernization versus local identity paradigm, the four case studies in Tianjin, Shanghai, Daqing, and Chongqing identify institutional changes that stimulated urban expansion. These mega-cities underwent cycles of fragmentation and consolidation. The power struggle between Chinese railway developers and foreign river conservancy bureaus devolved into a turf war that led to Tianjins expansion. Catastrophes created openings for the centralization of urban planning. The 1917 flood which damaged the Tianjin railway station forced Chinese and foreigners to collaborate and avert future disasters; The 1950 air raid in Shanghai prompted the local electrical power bureau to micro-manage power consumption of hundreds of factories. State policy had to be adapted to fit local realities. Oil workers of Daqing in the 1960s lived in decentralized settlements made of mud houses similar to those of local peasants. This was in line with state policy of social equality and also led to urban-rural integration. More recently, deindustrialization turns out to be the driving force for urban expansion. State-owned heavy industries in Chongqing have branched out to other industries and moved from the urban core into the periphery. Coordination between state and local authorities, careful rationing of resources, urban-rural integration, narratives of progress through memory-making, lay the groundwork for a model of high-density urban development unique to China. "
Angelina Chin,"Voices from the Sea: Fishers, Territorial Waters and  Ocean Culture ","In popular discourses, territories are often used to refer to lands. Little attention is paid to open waters and the people who spend time in them. This panel uses ocean/ sea as a central theme to examine how human activities in the waters complicate state policies, jurisdictional boundaries and the identities of the people working in the sea. A closer examination of open waters also sheds new light on the center/ periphery binary in national geography because while oceans and seas may be distant from administrative centers, many also serve as important contact zones between nations or regions. Xiaofei Gaos paper explores the fishery industries in coastal villages in southern Northeast China from the late 1940s to the Mao era, explicating how laborers in the sea destabilized conventional land-oriented class labels of workers and peasants. The work and earnings of fishermen disrupted the states campaign in creating equality among the rural population. Angelina Chins paper also focuses on the fisheries, but shifts the geographical focus to the sea border separating the mainland and colonial Hong Kong. The floating bodies and kidnapping cases on the coast of Lau Fau Shan give new geographical meanings to the Cultural Revolution. Tabitha Mallorys paper returns to the contemporary period and analyzes the ocean strategies as China emerged as a global maritime power. Along with the increasing state involvement were the efforts in creating a narrative portraying China as an ""ocean country"" and the development of an ocean culture to help people understand ocean affairs.  "
Tristan G. Brown,New Approaches in Chinese Environmental History:  Transregional and Frontier ,"This panel draws on the latest approaches in environmental history to explore the ways in which interactions between humans and their environments can help in reevaluating questions of territorial space, national sovereignty, and resource exploitation particularly for frontiers and borderlands in East Asia. Over the last two centuries, frontier regions not only experienced significant environmental change but also played important roles in the construction of national discourses surrounding both the meaning of nature and the execution of state-building projects. As frontier studies have occupied a central place in the environmental history of the United States, this panel examines the relevance of such an approach to China. Jonathan Schlesingers study traces transregional ecological transformations through resource consumption to reach conclusions regarding scale and boundary in Asian environmental history. Shifting this line of inquiry to local examples of resource protection, Tristan Browns paper examines legal cases that highlight the cultural strategies invoked in local courts along the Qings southwestern frontier for the maintenance of common resources and environments. Shellen Wus paper explores the role of Chinese frontiers in Republican-era discourses of national development and demonstrates how these discussions continue to inform questions of sovereignty today. In a similar vein, Micah Muscolinos paper examines efforts in water and soil conservation in northwestern China during the Second Sino-Japanese War and investigates their long-term legacies. In sum, this panel documents new approaches in Chinese environmental history by centering frontier spaces and aims to encourage discussion about the potential contributions of frontier studies to Chinese environmental history. "
Sandi Ward,"Beyond Digitization, Cross-Specialization ","Beyond Digitization, Cross-Specialization  Scholarship and librarianship are inextricably linked in this digital era. The volume of information available electronically may bewilder seasoned scholars. Meanwhile, shifting expectations for academic libraries may intimidate veteran librarians. Increased information access offers exciting opportunities for scholar-librarian cooperation, but complicates the traditional scholar-librarian relationship. The AAS conference provides a unique opportunity for scholars and librarians to come together, and we propose our panel as a chance for honest dialogue about scholars and librarians ambitions and concerns regarding digital scholarship. Three scholar-librarian pairs will discuss three recent collaborations across specializations. Zhaohui Xue and Yan Long discuss establishing a web archive of online content created by grassroots Chinese NGOs - a project whose politically-sensitive nature might have deemed it impossible without library support and faculty interest. Responding to the proliferation of databases for studying historical China, Feng En-tu and Lik Hang Tsui argue that academic libraries must train scholars in digital methodologies, and assert the need for discipline-specific software applications, data collections, and standards. Cecile Sun turns a critical eye toward digital humanities, questioning quantitative researchs value to the discipline. With Tianni Wang, she describes an oral history project that has convinced her of digital humanities potential and the possibilities for librarian-faculty cooperation. Discussants Peter Bol and Jim Cheng will facilitate conversation about the intersection of scholarship, instruction, and information management. "
Hsiao-wen Cheng,"Medicine, Material Culture, and Daily Life in Middle Period China ","Our roundtable examines the intersection of medicine, market, and material culture in Middle Period China. Rapid developments in Song era markets deeply impacted cultures of health, most obviously in the price, circulation, and knowledge of drug materials. Drug prices played a role in the popular perceptions of efficacy. New forms of medical knowledge influenced the Song states attempt to monopolize the import of medicinals, such as luxury aromatics from the Indian Ocean. Local drug markets merged with temple fairs, and the marketplace became an integral part of local healing practice. Meanwhile, physicians and literati variously embraced and pointedly rejected the norms of the marketplace, seeking health in the materiality of everyday life, rustic foods, and easy-to-get drug materials. How did professional physicians and amateurs respond to market factors and the changing conditions of daily lives? How does our attention to material culture illuminate medicine and healing culture during the Song and the Song-Yuan-Ming transition? What does our attention to the materiality of healing cultures illuminate about Chinas Middle Period? Each panelist will use a case study to discuss these questions. Margaret Ng examines the increasing use of frankincense in medicine for women in relation to state monopoly of imports. Hsiao-wen Cheng studies the Song differentiation between the two kinds of zhu (atractylodes rhizome)--cangzhu and baizhu--and the new attention drawn to the former. TJ Hinrichs explores thirteenth century valorizations of rustic foods and lifestyles as means to health, focusing on Lin Hongs Pure Offerings of Mountain Dwellers(Shanjia qinggong) and Pure Matters of Mountain Dwellers (Shanjia qingshi). Kai-hsiang Hsu investigates the development of a drug market in front of a Daoist temple, Yuju Guan, in Chengdu. Brigid Vance analyzes the recipes and advice for promoting healthy sleep and dreaming from the Song to the Ming included in An Explication of the Profundities in the Forest of Dreams (Menglin xuanjie). We will precirculate our materials to all those committed to attending the panel. Each panelist will present ten minutes only, leaving ample time for discussion. "
Margaret L. Boittin,Governing Society in Contemporary China and Taiwan ,"This panel focuses on the nexus of political authorities, laws, and social actors in contemporary China and Taiwan to explore how these states govern society.  Taking a multidisciplinary approach, it examines both how government officials engage with social actors and the implications for state-society relations.   Legal anthropology scholar Anya Bernstein analyzes how administrative law in Taiwan is shaped and interpreted by public law court judges and administrators.  Law and politics researcher Margaret Boittin highlights the ground-level tensions that play out between local level policing and health bureaucrats whose policies towards sex workers conflict with one another.  Management and politics professor Greg Distelhorst studies the biases of local officials when listening to ordinary citizens.  Political scientist Diana Fu examines Chinas new feminist movement and explains why the state has targeted it for repression. All four papers present new evidence on the points of contact between political authorities and ordinary citizens in China and Taiwan.  They also share common themes, with a focus on gender (Boittin and Fu), judicial and public security agencies (Bernstein, Boittin, Distelhorst, and Fu), and the behavior of local officials (Bernstein, Boittin, and Distelhorst).  The studies are also methodologically diverse, drawing on survey, interview, and ethnographic research methods.  Senior scholar Mary Gallagher, an expert on law, politics, and state-society relations in China, will discuss the papers in the context of the topical and theoretical themes. "
Luca Gabbiani,Of Rules and Men - the Qing Imperial Institutions and Their Legal Framework ,"From the earliest records available, institutions of government have developed in close interaction with the law. Turning their attention away from previously favored interpretations of the role of law in history, in recent decades, scholars of Chinas imperial regime have shed light on the extent to which the operation of its institutions was intricately linked to the dynamics of society and to the existence of a rich and evolving legal tradition. Benefitting from the existence of rich and abundant archival sources, central as well as local, Chinas late imperial period has been at the forefront of this innovative research, allowing for an ever-finer perception of the specific workings of the legislative machinery in its relation to the various components of the state and society. The four papers grouped in this panel jointly address the issue of the role of the law in framing the multidimensional workings of Qing dynasty institutions, from the perspective of central and territorial institutions. Each presenter will shed light on a specific facet of the question by combining an analysis of actual judicial cases, of legislation and its evolution, and of the different stages and actors of the judicial procedure. In combination, these contributions will provide the grounds for a renewed discussion of how exactly legal principles infused the ordinary workings of the Qings bureaucratic monarchy and on the intricate interrelation between the bureaucracy and society in the shaping of this process. "
Hua-yu Li,Stalin and China: Mining the Archives and Shedding New Light ,"In this panel, four scholars who have done extensive archival research in Russia and elsewhere address the important historical role played by Stalin in China from the late 1920s to the mid-1950s.  Four case studies on a range of topics shed new light on the great extent of Stalins influence on China, as well as its limits. Hua-yu Lis paper examines how Chinese students sent to Moscow in the mid- to late-1920s learned how to purge political adversaries through their own experiences in the midst of the brutal purges carried out during Stalins Cultural Revolution between 1928-1931. Alexander V. Pantsovs study explores the double game played by Chiang Kai-shek and Stalin as they competed to impose their respective visions on the relationship between China and the USSR. Deborah Kaple examines radically different reactions to Khrushchevs February 1956 denunciation of Stalin in the Soviet Union and China. Soviet citizens accepted the facts about Stalins crimes as presented by Khrushchev, but Chinese citizens reacted with shock and could not accept the Soviet condemnation of Stalin. Koji Hirata analyzes the reconstruction and expansion of the Anshan Steel and Iron Works (Angang), one of the 156 central projects of Chinas first Five-Year Plan (1953-57), launched with aid from Stalin. Even in this era of learning from Stalins Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet relationship at the local level was characterized by tension, miscommunication, and miscalculations. "
Clark L. Alejandrino,Disasters and the Reimagining of Modern China ,"Far from externalities disrupting normal life, disasters and disaster planning became constitutive elements of modern Chinas social organization and historical imagination. Yet studies have only begun to grapple with this fact. Depending on the particular circumstances in which disasters occurred or were expected to occur, Chinese leaders, scientists, and bureaucrats used different frames to mediate the meanings of disaster and in the process produced new subjectivities and ways of knowing and organizing society and the world. Using insights from cultural history, environmental history, and science and technology studies, this panel examines three understudied disasters (earthquakes, wartime bombing, and typhoons) at extraordinary junctures in Chinese history (late Qing national humiliation, the threat of Chinas demise in WWII, and mass mobilization under Mao) to examine how they were appropriated to refashion notions of history, nation, and community, and effect social change.  Daniel Hausmann looks at how the introduction of the earthquake table fissured dynastic notions of time and buttressed a national history of suffering in the early Republic. John B. Thompson examines how unpredictable destruction by Japanese bombs in World War II Chongqing led planners to a new technocratic view of Chinese society as a network of crucial industrial and social functions arranged in physical space. As Clark Alejandrino shows, modern meteorology and mass mobilization in 1950s Guangdong transformed local organizations and understandings against typhoons while legitimizing Communist rule.  Judith Shapiro and Grace Shen, who have worked on the history of Chinese disasters and science, are discussant and chair respectively. "
Nicholas Morrow Williams,Sensory Pleasures and Perils in Premodern China ,"Confucius said that he had never met anyone who loved virtue (de) as much as sensual pleasure (se), tacitly admitting that virtue and pleasure are not easily dissociated. Ever since, the pleasures of the senses have been fraught with profound moral and political ramifications in Chinese cultural tradition. Drawing on the insights of previous scholarship by Ronald Egan, Craig Clunas, Jonathan Hay, and others, our panel sheds new light on the cultural meaning of sensory pleasures. How were the pleasures of the senses--whether tactile, olfactory, gustatory, visual, or auditory--both regulated and also defined by political concerns, and how could cultural norms and ideals be represented materially? We examine the representation of sensory experience in various literary genres from different periods of imperial China, using both interdisciplinary readings of received texts and also newly discovered or overlooked materials. David Knechtges examines the early discourse of the perils of immoderation via a newly discovered Han manuscript, but Hsiang-lin Shih shows how the allure of swords and feminine beauty were used for political ends in the early medieval period. Nicholas M. Williams analyzes the allegorical implications of floral fragrances in Southern Song ci lyrics, while Guojun Wang unveils the materiality of genres via a close study of clothing in the writings of Kong Shangren. By restoring the broader cultural contexts of tangible and mundane experience, our papers offer initial forays toward a history of both the pleasures and perils of the senses in premodern China. "
Austin Dean,The Extension of Credit in Modern Chinese History ,"This panel brings together historians, economists, and political scientists who use different approaches and methodologies to study the extension of credit in Chinese history. Qiao examines how Shanxi merchants, through credit-extension and account balancing, created new transactional practices on the northern frontier of the Qing Empire where precious metal was in short supply. Deans paper examines why a consortium of foreign banks was willing to lend money to the Qing, and then the Beiyang government, for currency reform. The paper by Manconi provides new insights on the effects of the infamous Silver Purchase Act of 1934 by conducting an econometric analysis on the records of a Tianjin bank. Finally, Chen investigates the capital structure and loan portfolio of the China Development Bank in the present day to show the relation between political and economic goals. Taken together, these papers examine the economic, political, diplomatic, and personal factors that influence the extension of credit. At a broader level, the panel aims to increase interdisciplinary communication by providing a forum to share perspectives, tools, and approaches. "
Julian Gewirtz,Zhao Ziyangs Legacy: A Reassessment ,"When Chinas deposed former leader Zhao Ziyang died under house arrest in 2005, his 59-character-long official obituary was notable primarily for its omissions: referring to Zhao only as a comrade, it did not mention that he had served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (1987-1989), Premier of the State Council (1980-1987), or Party Secretary of Sichuan Province (1975-1980). Zhao who was at the pinnacle of Chinese politics for nearly a decade from 1980-1989 has been erased from most official Chinese accounts of the period, and scholarship about Zhao has long been limited by a lack of access to essential source material. Recently, however, scholars have benefitted from a wide range of major new insights, sources, and arguments regarding Zhaos contributions and these new sources have led to a reevaluation of Zhaos contested legacy. This roundtable will reassess Zhao Ziyang by examining five interrelated topics: (1) Zhaos overall legacy as an economic and political reformer and national leader; (2) Zhaos workstyle and policy orientations; (3) his interactions with other CCP elites (including Hu Yaobang and Deng Xiaoping) that led ultimately to his overthrow in 1989; (4) Zhaos role in Chinas foreign relations, notably U.S.-China relations; and (5) how the understanding of Zhaos legacy has been altered by the appearance of newly available materials. Professor David Shambaugh, who published the first biography of Zhao in 1984, will chair and direct the panel, while also addressing the first issue. Professor Wu Guoguang, a former official who worked under and closely with Zhao will discuss the second issue. Robert Suettinger, former senior CIA analyst and NSC Director for Asia under President Clinton, closely followed Chinese domestic politics in the 1980s and will speak about the third issue. Former U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord interacted directly with Zhao and observed him in his government capacity, will discuss the fourth issue. Julian Gewirtz, who has recently published a book examining Zhaos economic reforms and their international interconnections, will discuss the fifth issue. All participants will address the fundamental question of what Zhao Ziyangs legacy means for contemporary Chinese history, for the study of Chinese politics, and for Chinas future. "
Wen-Yi Huang,New Perspectives on Migration in Chinese History ,"In all eras, people, goods, and ideas traveled into, across, and out of what is now China. Recent years have seen a rising interest in the study of migration in contemporary China, yet migration in the imperial period remains an under-researched topic. This panel focuses on the political, economic, social contexts of human mobility in China through case studies from various historical periods. In the light of recently excavated sources from the Qin and early Western Han periods, Korolkov investigates the role of state control over mobile populations in the formation of early Chinese empires. Settlers are usually presented as colonizers and agents of the empire, yet, as Tsai shows, settlers often adapted to the place they settled. He shows this through a comparison of how the Qing and Russian Empires perceived and reacted to the nativization of their settlers in Central Eurasia. Huangs paper turns attention from migrants to the left-behind families. By analyzing cases of ransom and cross-border transportation of the deceased during the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties, she reveals how migration shifted boundaries of home and family. In contrast to the above three papers that focus on separation and dislocation, Ebrey argues that frequent large-scale migration, even when involuntary, in time helped make possible Chinas repeated unifications by bringing people of different localities, languages, and customs together. "
Yu-chih Lai,"Canton, Beijing, and the Court: Chinese Export Painting Revisited ","So-called Chinese export paintings usually refer to paintings from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries made by annoymous artisans in Canton for a Euro-Amercian market. These paintings are often seen as mass produced souvenirs and as such, treated as works with little aesthetic values, and therefore relegated to the margins of art history as an isolated genre of study. Consequently, very little attention has been paid to their connection with mainstream Chinese art and the significance of local production in the making of art for a foreign audience. This panel intends to shed new light on the subject of export art by examining the court-city-port production network of an eighteenth century China. There are four papers covering export art productions in Canton and Beijing, their relationship with Chinese material culture, court workshop pratice, and finally their post-China biographies in Europe. By expanding the geographical scope to include the inland, these papers will shift from the China/West narrative that has long dominated the field of export art. It will also expand the West to include export artworks in Russian collections, adding another node in the network of commerical art in Qing China. It endeavors to show how export paintings were not merely the product of foreign fantasy or the monopoly of the coastal cities but enjoyed a reciprocal interaction with traditional Chinese art practices and has played a significant role in shaping an understanding of China. Therefore, they are an indispensable link to understanding later Chinese art from a global perspective.  "
Yuyu (Lara) Yang,"Two-part Panel: Knowledge Production, Reading Practice, and Meaning Making in ","As books, journals, comics, pamphlets and big character posters were produced in diverse ways for new purposes during the Mao era, who read them, and more importantly,  how did they read them? For reading was a fraught and contested process during the early PRC, as intellectuals and academic work came under intense scrutiny, mass literacy and education campaigns created new reading communities, and collective reading became a fundamental feature of political study processes. These papers demonstrate how the CCP sought to use mediated reading practices to extend its governmental reach to shape communities and individuals throughout the Mao era. Focusing on the early PRC, DeMare explores how urban intellectuals interpretations of party policies and revolutionary narratives determined the dynamics of land reform in local communities. Sun illuminates the imposition of state censorship on personal reading during the Cultural Revolution and its limitations. Despite these efforts, however, Henningsen and Mittler suggest that there were continuities in reading practices and forms of meaning from before and after the Cultural Revolution, and indicate ways that readers were often creative participants in the process of meaning making, forming communities of reading whose importance might go far beyond the process of readerly and writerly engagement. Together, these panels map the entire communications circuit (Darnton) for Maoist China from the conception and planning of texts to their material production and circulation to readers consumption and reaction and link it to broader dynamics of state building and governmentality. "
Jonathan E. E. Pettit,Big Data Analysis of Chinese Religions on Social Media Under Xi Jinping Regime ,"Any scholar in the humanities and social science who studies China would face a dilemma about original data. On the one hand, accesses to archival documents, to elite individuals, and to social surveys are often restricted and the obstacles are too difficult to overcome. On the other hand, the wealth of available data is beyond any individuals capability to digest in a lifetime. What makes the task all the more daunting is the datas variety, which ranges from historical gazetteers and maps to the news, images, and social media posts of our time. This unprecedented volume of information can, however, also be considered a sealed treasure trove that, once opened, has the potential to illuminate past and present in ways hitherto thought closed for lack of practical methods to give the findings shape and meaning.         The panels purpose is to present some of these methods and see how they can be brought to bear on society, politics, or religion in China. Since computational methods cover a wide range and include spatial, temporal, network, and textual analysis, as well as techniques of graphic, cartographic, and virtual visualization, scholars of different disciplinary background, endowed with different expertise, should feel at home participating.  We hope is that the mutual stimulation that results will initiate a new computational approach to the understanding of China. We will particularly focus on big data analysis of social media about religions posted since 2012. "

The papers have broad geographical coverage: US-China relations, Japan-South Korea-US relations, China-South Korea-US relations, and Chinese domestic politics and foreign policy. Their research questions tackle pressing issues of theoretical and policy concern, including: 1) why does China increasingly employ coercive diplomacy toward South Korea, pressuring Seoul to abandon a US missile defense system despite an objectively worsening threat from North Korea? 2) What are the prospects for domestic politics to allow for improved Japan-South Korea relations in this rapidly changing threat environment? 3) Why is Chinas rise to great power status in the 21st century different from those of the past, and what does that mean for the applicability of existing theories to this contemporary case? And 4) during a period in which both Chinas material capabilities/influence and concerns about U.S. commitment to global leadership are increasing, what determines how Chinese leaders conceptualize leadership and how likely they are to pursue such a role internationally? "
Francis L. F. Lee,Postcolonial Identity Politics in Hong Kong ,"The salience and radicalization of identity politics in Hong Kong is one of the most unprecedented and unexpected changes since the end of Britishcolonial rule. Despite Chinas economic enticements and intense efforts to promote patriotism, a variety of localist identities and movements have flourished in Hong Kong among a younger generation, with some activists making the once unthinkable claim for political independence.  How does one analytically define Hong Kong and Hong Konger? This panel examines the multiple and contradictory trajectories of identity politics and value change in Hong Kong in the past two decades and especially after the Umbrella Movement laid bare the governments forceful means to exert political control and revealed its determination to redefine the One Country Two Systems formula. The first paper uses aggregate longitudinal data to document the publics growing sense of political efficacy even as they register declining confidence in formal political institutions.  Another paper reinforces the panels focus on the evolution of diverse political identities as social movements and political regime become increasingly contentious.  Zeroing in on the spectrum of localist politics and identities, a third paper highlights the drastically changed relationship between a region and a political center.  The final paper uses the transmission of Hong Kongs collective memory towards June 4th 1989 to trace how a young generation of Hong Kong citizens gain diverse moral sensibilities and rapidly reposition themselves in face of a China that had turned from a nuanced cultural formation to an uncompromising political authority. "
Daan Pan,Healing Is a Many-Splendored Thing: Re-framing Interdisciplinary Relations and ,"The interdisciplinary implications of traditional Asian medicine and the rising popular enthusiasm for alternative healing modalities call for more concerted interdisciplinary scholarly efforts to expand ongoing inquiries and open new frontiers. This panel integrates complementary approaches to examine interdisciplinary relations and narratives of traditional Chinese and Tibetan medicines and promote dialogues across the disciplines. Panel paper topics include a) a historical examination of the transformation of the perception of the medical body following Chinas 1913 anatomy law, b) a literary study problematizing the cultural-ethical values underlying Chinese medical and literary narratives about the practice of medicinal cannibalism; c) an interartistic study of the poetics of Chinese narrative medicine in the context of emotional health and healing; and d) an anthropological framing of cultural narratives about epidemics and epidemiology in medieval Tibet. A coherent theme overarching this panel is the re-framing of multi-faceted interdisciplinary relationship in traditional Chinese and Tibetan medicines. This re-framing offers valuable clues for understanding the evolution and diversity of Asian medical traditions while also problematizing Traditional Chinese Medicine as a unified system of medical orthodoxy. Another shared theme is the re-framing of interdisciplinary narratives about Asian medicine. Specifically, these narratives are historical, ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual, which encompass the medical body, the medicinal body, emotional hygiene, and epidemiology. Such narrative-framing, while identifying contributory factors for the survival and sustainability of traditional Asian medicine, helps to both critique and preserve these traditions. Furthermore, it sheds an interdisciplinary light on the representations of medicine in Asian intellectual traditions. "

Brandon Dotson,"Indian Gods, Chinese Trigrams, and the Transmission and Assimilation of ","As a poor cousin of both science and religion, a begrudged relative of ritual and play, divination persists in the margins of established traditions. Nevertheless, divinations often highly specific methods and its material culture recommend it as an excellent topic for larger studies of the transmission and assimilation of traditions across cultural and linguistic boundaries. This panel highlights such process through case studies of Chinese divination texts spanning three millennia. Two papers bring divergent areal and methodological perspectives to bear on a single text, a circa 9th-century Dunhuang manuscript called the Moxishouluoor Method of MaheÅ›vara. Constance Cooks paper applies Sinological methods to situate this tradition with respect to the deep Chinese past, drawing on 4th and 1st-century BCE divination texts. Brandon Dotsons paper adopts a comparative and material cultural perspective to place the same text in a tradition that traces back to India, and which was transmitted to Tibetans and Turks along the Silk Road. Kelsey Seymours paper explores a system of divination also associated with the Hindu deity MaheÅ›vara, assimilated by Chinese Buddhists during the Tang. Here a tantric master identifies with MaheÅ›vara and commands a spirit to speak through a child. Beverley McGuire brings to bear a religious studies approach by investigating a 17th-century commentary to the 6th-century Divination Sutra that discusses the place of divination in Buddhism vis-Ã -vis conventional and ultimate truths. Together, and through their intersections, these papers open a discussion of processes of transmission, assimilation, and religious appropriation of a given ritual technology. "
Xiaolin Duan,Nature and Cities: Discovering the Transformed Urban Environment in China ,"Chinese metropolises, like cities elsewhere, rely on the consumption and harnessing of natural resources for survival. With successes and failures, engineering projects have not only transformed the urban environment, but also reshaped close, yet complex, relationships between the urban population and the environment. Engineering the environment has been essential to urban growth in China for centuries, though historical changes of the urban environment remained less noticeable in contrast with the excessive attention given to the outward prosperity of cities. Drawing on theories from environmental and ecological studies, the history of science and technology, cultural geography, and urban planning, this highly interdisciplinary panel explores the transformed urban environment in Hangzhou, Kaifeng, and Tianjin of imperial and modern China. All four papers emphasize the history of urban engineering and address interactions between humanity and nature in urban spaces. Chen explores the ecological changes taking place in the Northern Song Kaifeng with the massive inflow of nonnative animal and plant species into the citys numerous gardens and parks. Duans paper examines the Hangzhou municipal governments effort to regulate and urbanize West Lake through a balance between economic profit and ecological sustainability in the Song Dynasty. Wangs study focuses on water control projects in Tianjin and the changing riparian communities in the Qing dynasty. Hes research investigates the engineering programs near West Lake conducted by the communist state with particular attention to the unexpected ecological failure caused by algae bloom in the 1950s. "
Lara R. Kusnetzky,Making Subjects Fit to Rule: Cultural Revolutions in Twentieth-Century China ,"A cultural revolution, Mao Zedong argued in 1940, was necessary to create New China. Revolutionary culture was consequential not because it reflected revolutionary politics and economy, but because it prepared the ideological ground for the establishment of a new society and a new state under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Mao invested the Marxist concept of culture (wenhua) with voluntarism. Culture became a pedagogical and a political force in its own right, a means to measure and to mobilize national development. After 1949, the Party would use cultural revolutions to disseminate the Communist worldview, create proletarian literature and art, combat illiteracy, develop scientific knowledge, and radicalize social relations. The aim was to cultivate revolutionary citizens who were not just politically committed and emotionally connected to the Communist cause, but possessed the level of culture that socialist governance required. These revolutionary citizens would use weapon and word to realize the Partys shifting vision of Chinese modernity. This panel examines the concept and practice of cultural revolutions to demonstrate the dynamic, changing role of culture in Chinese Communist ideology and governance. Mark McConaghy explores the Partys effort to revolutionize culture in the 1930s and 1940s. Lara Kusnetzky analyzes the empowerment of the proletariat through the writing of factory history in 1958. Patricia Thornton shows that the cultivation of literate citizens was central to the revolutionary politics of the 1950s and 1960s. Fabio Lanza investigates the radical re-thinking of education and hence the democratization of culture in the 1970s. "
Lei Lin,"Connecting the Empire: New Perspectives on Transport, Communication, and ","The panel explores the Qing Empire (1644-1912) as a spatial-temporal construct and its empire-building as a project of producing and consolidating the physical space of empire. While Qing China has received much scholarly attention as an early modern empire, the technical aspect of its territorial expansion and management of its varied geography are still far from being thoroughly understood. This panel thus asks about the ways in which the empire connected and synchronized its vast territories and frontiers. Specifically, we focus on the transport, communication, and calendrical systems, which made possible military operations in frontiers, large-scale logistic arrangements, long-distance information transmission, all of which worked to hold the imperial realm together. We will examine strategies, technologies, and practices employed to develop and maintain an empire-wide and, in some cases, transregional network that facilitated information and material exchange between different places within and beyond the empire. Through case studies addressing multiple localities and stages of Qing History, we hope to contribute to the understanding of Qing by constructing a panoramic and chronological narrative of the evolvement of its circulation system. Papers explore high-Qing military logistics and communication in the trans-Himalayan region, late-Qing establishment of international telecommunication and tension with foreign entities, extension of the postal system into Mongolia and Tibet, and imperial control of the calendar and time in the context of Inner Asian expansion. Our discussant will contribute remarks based on his recent work on information system, military logistics, and the maintenance of empire in British India and Chinese contexts. "
Lan Wu,Spatial Statecraft: Urban Political Narratives in Late Imperial and Early Republican ,"Over the course of the late Imperial and early Republican eras, the state defined and controlled the key spaces of Beijing including its palaces, academies, temples, streets, walls, and borders. Rather than passive settings for the display of state power, these spaces were dynamic arenas in which the rulers shaped their identities and built the foundations of their rule. This interdisciplinary panel examines the ways in which architecture and authority intersected in Beijing from the Ming through the early Republic. Campbell investigates the major factors impacting the design of the imperial palaces in the Yongle reign and how they contributed to the construction of his imperial identity. Wu considers how two Qing emperors articulated a new imperial imagination in remaking Beijings Lama Temple in the eighteenth century. Barish discusses several buildings associated with imperial education, examining the relationship between architecture and changing knowledge regimes from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. Finally, Yu focuses on the Embassy District and the development of Changan Avenue in the late Qing and early Republican years, exploring the relationship between disruptions in the spatial order and challenges to state rule. Using a broad range of sources and methodologies, these papers propose new ways of reading urban spaces as sources of power in state-building in Beijing over a period of approximately five centuries. "
Naixi Feng,Knowledge of Exotica: Writing the Other and Placing the Self in Early Modern ,"Knowledge about exotica was in constant motion in early modern China. This panel parses the discursive roles of exotica as textual objects in Chinese historiography and literature from the early seventeenth to late nineteenth centuries. We explore how a variety of men of letters adapted ideas of the foreign and the strange to respond, on the one hand, to social and political transformations, and reflect, on the other, upon their own cultural, political, and ethnic identities. The four papers draw on assorted materials antiquity catalogues, miscellaneous jottings, bannerman drama, and popular fiction to discuss how knowledge producers manipulated discourses of exotica to situate themselves and the empires they inhabited in relation to borderlands, foreign countries, and spiritual realms. Representations of exotic phenomena, such as tribute goods, imported weaponry, foreign languages and customs, and the alien sight of a mushroom cloud over an explosion, place exotica in their contemporary worlds while also responding to earlier literary archetypes. Such retrospective gestures are integral to many of the discourses in which writing about exotica in early modern China were embedded. Our studies reveal a set of strategies that domesticated, classified, and politicized common knowledge of foreign objects and collective memories of strange spectacles. We combine literary history with discussions of ethnicity, urban space, visual and material culture to show how, in a broader sense, texts intersected with social realities, and more specifically, how writing the exotic framed meditations on the dynamics of familiar and strange, self and other, past and present. "
Brian Lander,"Living with the Yangzi: Technology, State Power, and Environmental Change in the ","The Central Yangzi River basin was once among the largest wetlands in Asia, but is now a fertile agricultural region and the economic core of central China. In order to live in this dynamic hydraulic system, humans have transformed it, a process that began as early as Hunans 7000-year-old rice paddies and culminated with Hubeis Three Gorges Dam. While a few Western-language studies discuss the regions environmental history from c. 1500 to 1949, this panel seeks to expand the temporal frame by surveying earlier and later developments. Our goal is to explore how people have dealt with the dominance of water in this region over an extended period of time and, in turn, how that long history affected state-led waterworks in the twentieth century. Central to our analyses are interactions between the regions hydrology and various state actors, technologies, and laboring bodies. The first paper considers the regions transformation over the millennia since farming began, focusing on the interplay of demographics and state-led water control projects. The second focuses on how people moved within this water-world, adapting to seasonal and longer term environmental changes. The third focuses on the 1950s, when the new communist government mobilized mass labor and new technologies to turn much of Dongting Lake into productive rice fields. The final paper looks at the conception and construction of the Three Gorges Dam, which was arguably built for ideological as much as hydrological reasons, and has profoundly disrupted the seasonal cycle of the lowlands. "
Dasa Mortensen,Communist Processes and Mao-Era Policies in the Ethnic Borderlands of Western ,"Over the past few decades, an increasing amount of scholarship has been published on Mao-era political and social campaigns, including land reform, the Great Leap Forward, collectivization, and the Cultural Revolution. However, the majority of this scholarship has focused on areas of the country that are predominately inhabited by ethnic Han Chinese residents. In Chinas ethnic borderland regions, political campaigns often followed different timelines and led to different social and political outcomes than in Han majority areas. What were some of the biggest hurdles that the Communist Party faced in spreading socialist policies into rural ethnic minority areas? How informed were Han Communist Party leaders about local social, religious, and political conditions in diverse regions of the country and to what extent did the Party adjust its policies to account for ethnic and religious differences in these regions? What were the backgrounds and motivations of the Kazakh, Hui, and Tibetan cadres who joined the Chinese Communist Party and carried out policies in their local communities? In addressing these questions, this interdisciplinary panel draws on data collected through ethnographic research, oral history interviews, and close readings of Chinese government documents in Yunnan Province, the Tibetan Autonomous Region, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Panelists analyze the ways in which particular Tibetan, Hui, and Kazakh communities participated in land reform, collectivization, and the Cultural Revolution, and they demonstrate how villagers memories of Mao-era policies are often at variance with the written accounts stored in archives or recorded in Chinese government publications. "
Mei Li Inouye,Jiang Qing (1914-1991) from Multiple Perspectives ,"In this panel, international scholars specializing in art, history, film, and theater juxtapose their distinct lenses to bring forth interdisciplinary understandings of Jiang Qing (1914-1991) that extend beyond historical and political interpretations of Jiang Qing as the wife of Mao Zedong and ringleader of the Gang of Four. This panel will offer interpretations of Jiang Qing as a left-wing performer of drama and film in 1930s Shanghai, as the subject of a wealthy transnational biographical industry, and as the target of caricatures loaded with specific cultural references. These analyses will illuminate new understandings of Jiang Qing that contribute to modern and contemporary Chinese representations of gender, the genre of biography in China and the West, and the use of visual language in socio-political changes in early post-Cultural Revolution China. They will also suggest through conflict and comparison alternative modes of thinking within and across the above disciplines. "
William H. Nienhauser,Establishing and Reading a Han Text: Recent Studies of Sima Qians Shiji ,"This panel includes four papers that explore both the original text of and recent studies on Sima Qians Shiji. Hans van Esss Thoughts on Recent Studies on the Shiji and Han shu provides a framework for the panel by examining the studies in China of these two closely related Han-dynasty texts from the 1960s through the present day, drawing important conclusions concerning the gradual diminishing interest in both texts in the Chinese academy. Weiguo Caos Mythical Accounts in the Grand Scribes Records takes a comparative approach to Sima Qians predilection for the marvelous, utilizing traditional commentaries and parallel passages in other early texts as a key to Sima Qians motives for including such accounts. Marc NÃ_rnbergers Notions of Text as Presented by the Shiji is once again concerned with the text, but NÃ_rnbergers interests are in how traditional commentaries shaped the notion of the work as a text as well as how it should be read. William H. Nienhauser, Jr.s Concerning the Received Text of the Shiji focuses on the text of the new (2014) Zhonghua version of chapter 123, The Memoir on Ferghana, noting the problems that remain in this edition and what they mean for readers of the Shiji in the future. The panel thus affords scholars interested in the Shiji with an introduction to scholarship both traditional and modern as well as guidelines for reading, studying and translating the text in the future. "
Lu Liu,(In)visible Body in Motion: Visual Practices and Social Movements in Modern China ,"The panel examines the dialectics of (in)visibility in relation to the multilayered frictions between the state and the individual body. Visualization, the magic of making perceptible and thus knowable, has long been integral to the states art of governance. The process of re-ordering social relations, nonetheless, is full of crevices and apertures that produce possibilities of creative re-appropriation, re-circulation, and seeing otherwise. Visual practices in the volatile history of modern China thus serve as a privileged arena for social and political contestation, providing mechanisms for both mobilization of and resistance by grassroots actors. The body exposed to the perils of visualization also complicates the power dynamics by making visible what would be infinitesimal, ephemeral, repressed, or silenced. The panel starts with Shaoqian Zhangs paper on the representation of the negative aspects of the New Woman around the time of the New Life Movement. Lu Liu argues that visual abjection in the Four Pests Campaign participates in the making of human subjects through creating a hygienic/political category of the pest. Yang Wang examines visualizations of peasants through a hybridized genre of figure painting that ameliorated anxieties about the growing urban-rural divide. Nick Smith investigates the use of graffiti as resistance to urban redevelopment and demolition, exploring how the materiality of this visual practice appropriates the idiom of official discourse and evades restrictions on public speech. The four papers, following the production, circulation, reception, and re-production of visual practices, altogether explore the politics of visual economy and the visuality of political movements. "
Thomas C. Chen,Through Fractured Lenses: Revisiting Revolutionary Chinese Cinema and Its ,"The cinematic legacies of the Maoist era are hotly debated today. How to reevaluate this multitudinous heritage as well as its afterlives is the subject of this panel. While a veneer of uniformity often covers its remembrance, the papers in this panel take a variety of comparative approaches, both geographical and historical, to resuscitate the heterogeneous products, experiences, and effects of Chinese revolutionary cinema, both then and in the post-revolutionary present. Investigating the Peoples Republic of Chinas (PRC) cinematic transactions with East and West Germany in the 1950s, Thomas Chen demonstrates the unorthodox ways in which films were received that cut across the demarcation of the socialist and capitalist worlds. In her paper Qian He likewise challenges border-drawing and the construction and deconstruction of dichotomous identities in looking at contemporaneous portrayals of the ""struggle session"" in films from the PRC and the Republic of China (ROC). In reading the experience of Maoist moviegoing as torture, Chenshu Zhou proposes an alternative conception of cinemas link with the body. Finally, Zhuoyi Wang analyzes how a remake of a red classic reveals its repressed hybridity and the uses to which it is currently put in the context of global capitalism. These four papers show how cinema of the revolutionary period continues to prompt the redrawing of boundaries and the reanimation of bodies. "
Thomas E. Kellogg,Engaging a Closing China ,"International engagement with China is increasingly difficult. Within China, a deepening domestic political chill is steadily limiting the space for international exchanges in a range of fields, including business, government, academia, civil society, media, and culture. Foreign actors are finding it more challenging to maintain existing programs and activities in China, and to build new contacts among Chinese counterparts.  Internationally, political shifts in the West have contributed to rising tensions between China and the outside world. In America, the Trump administration has publicly questioned key tenets of the US-China relationship. In Australia, the influence of mainland China within Australian university campuses and community groups has emerged as a hot-button domestic political issue. This panel will explore both the reasons for the conservative turn in Chinas domestic politics, and the options facing international actors that have been engaged with China, some since the beginning of the reform era.  How should key international groups operating in China - including major private foundations, top Western universities, and key global cultural institutions - respond to the tightening operating space? How might these trends affect long-standing educational relationships between China and the West, from foreign Ph.D students seeking to do academic research in Chinese archives to the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students currently enrolled in schools overseas? And what is the appropriate role of Western governments in responding to these trends? This roundtable panel will embrace an innovative format: presentations will be kept very short (5-8 minutes), to encourage discussion among the panelists, and also with the audience. In addition, each panelist will be encouraged to discuss the above questions through the prism of his or her own on-the-ground experience: Elizabeth Knup and Tom Kellogg will talk about the ways in which foreign foundations have responded to the challenging environment; Orville Schell will discuss how a major US-based NGO has responded; and Carl Minzner and John Fitzgerald will discuss the ways in which international academic collaboration has been impacted by recent trends. In addition to serving as chair, Kaiser Kuo will discuss the impact on the business sector. "
Sarah  Mellors,"(Re)claiming the Womb: Abortion, Reproductive Hygiene, and the Fickle State in ","This panel examines the evolution of the field of reproductive medicine and the concentration and dispersal of state power throughout twentieth-century China. By investigating four successive periods spanning the Republican (1911-1949) and Mao (1949-1976) eras, we highlight how approaches to reproductive medicine changed along with shifting political anxieties and societal concerns. As state power and commitment waxed and waned, diverse views about health and gender roles, local contingencies, and inconsistent policies frequently undermined efforts to standardize reproductive practices. From the perspective of high level state actors and reformist elites, reproductive medicine offered possibilities for disseminating proper gender roles, delineating ethnic hierarchies, and curtailing deviant behaviors. At the same time, patients and individuals practicing medicine at the grassroots private practitioners, Barefoot Doctors, and Ethnic Hygiene Teams played a critical role in contesting, implementing, and redirecting the states medical agenda. Ling Ma and Sarah Mellors trace the shift from Republican era natalism to aggressive population planning during the 1970s, illuminating how state efforts to promote certain reproductive practices and limit others had unforeseen and deeply gendered consequences. Shenglan Li and Xiaoshun Zeng highlight how efforts to reform minority communities reproductive practices during the Republican era paved the way for so-called ethnic hygiene programs in the early Peoples Republic. By focusing on reproductive medicine, these four papers demonstrate the centrality of the womb to Nationalist and Communist statecraft and the ways in which medical practitioners and patients shaped these projects. "
Suisui  Wang,"Contextualizing (un)queer Kinship: Family Change, Transnational Mobilities, and ","Family practices by people practicing homoeroticism in China have to date been researched primarily under the rubric of sexuality studies, which places an overemphasis on the role of sexual identities and leaves the heteronormative assumption of family and family studies intact (Brainer, 2017). This interdisciplinary panel challenges this long-existing intellectual division of labor by probing the structural, relational, sociospatial, and gendered contingencies of both queerness and kinship. Panelists from the fields of Sociology, Gender Studies, and Media Studies shed light on various family practices associated homoeroticism in Chinese societies, including long-term same-sex couplehood and parenthood, family acceptance of homosexual children, transnational migrations impact on stretched kinship and gay mens decision to enter heterosexual marriage. Drawing from empirical and representational materials and blending ethnographic and textual approaches, they uncover the process whereby non-normative sexualities, conjugality, and parenthood may be embedded within the Chinese/Confucian family/kinship/marriage system. Specifically, this panel asks: What is queer (and unqueer) about these conjugal, intergenerational, and marital practices? What forms of values/norms are upheld and constructed by different agents in family, challenging certain dimensions of heteronormativity while leaving other facets intact? How are Chinese conceptions of the family in turn impacted by homoerotic desires, sexual liaisons, and even formal partnership and parenthood? By laying bare the imbrication of both the queer/disruptive/anti-normative and the unqueer/conformist/normative components in Chinese family dynamics and mapping territories of ambiguity in the landscape of both kinship and queerness, this panel explores recent theoretical calls for queering family of origin and queer theory without antinormativity. "
Jie Guo,"Imagining Foreignness: Race, Nation, and the Body in Early Modern Chinese ","This panel engages interdisciplinary dialogues on race, the body, and transnational imaginations of foreignness in early modern Chinese literary and historical narratives, focusing on these questions: How do Chinese representations of foreigners and foreignness expand canonical boundaries of discourses about race and ethnicity? How do representations of racialized and/or sexualized bodies in early modern narratives generate new understandings of self and other, and at the same time echo the emerging discourse of nation? What models of body politics do narratives of and about foreign bodies in early modern Chinese literary and historical writings produce? What social and political analogy could such models of body politics produce? How does sexualization of racial ambivalence and ethnic identities problematize gaze, spectatorship, voyeurism, and imaginations of the Other? Seeking to address these questions, this panel provides four papers on the following topics: 1) representations of Burmas last king Thibaw, whose fate for late Qing and early Republican Chinese intellectuals became the very embodiment of a failed nation; 2) depictions of foreign princesses in nineteenth-century Chinese chantefable novels and shifting discourses of gender and nationhood; 3) discussions of gender order and female sexuality at the center of late Qing lawmakers debates over Chinese national essence in relation to Western civilizations; 4) the impact of emerging Chinese nationalism on representations of the Tibetan body. Collectively, the panelists explore how representations of foreign bodies in early modern Chinese narratives project new modes of empathy and cross-cultural identification, and yield nascent expressions of desire, motives and geopolitical aspirations. "
Shih-Pei Chen,Local Gazetteers as a Database: New Digital Research Methods ,"Gazetteers are an important genre of text, lying somewhere between local histories and geographies. But while gazetteers are full of text they are not a purely textual genre. They are full tables and lists composed of bits of numerical and textual data, often with cross-references. This data was not intended to be read cover-to-cover, rather it served as reference material and collective summary. With the advent of digital technologies, textual materials have become far more accessible than ever before. The large scale of digital materials fundamentally changes the types of questions we can ask. Where these sources contain structured data, they should not be treated strictly as text. LoGaRT is a suite of tools built specifically for tagging and extracting data from gazetteers. It allows gazetteers to be used not just individually to look up information, but collectively as a database. Our four panelists will give presentations considering the format and structure of gazetteers as sources and the methodological implications of using them as a database. Shih-Pei Chen will begin by demonstrating the capabilities of the LoGaRT tools that the other presenters used in their research. Qun Che used LoGaRT to track environmental change connected to  water conservancy projects, Joseph Dennis used it to construct a database of school library book collections, and Ian Miller to analyze the structure and compilation of numerical tax data. To leave maximum time for audience participation we will convene this panel without a discussant and keep presentations to no more than 10 minutes. "
Ling Chen,New Perspectives on Chinese Political Economy: Firms as Agents of Change ,"What is the political role of capitalists and business in China? While a great deal of scholarship has examined how party-state institutions and intergovernmental arrangements have contributed to or hindered Chinas growth, far fewer scholars have examined firms as agents of economic change and authors of Chinas unique system. This panel brings together papers by scholars of diverse geography, rank, and background on the theme of firms as actors in reform-era China. The papers examine interactions between firms and the Chinese state, taking different approaches to how business behavior affect state power and induce institutional change. Ling Chens paper (with Florian Hollenbach) uses a large dataset of firms effective tax rates between 1996-2008 to argue that firms with mobile assets have greater bargaining power vis-Ã -vis local governments and are better able to extract tax incentives. Lizhi Liu (with Barry Weingast) argues that the CCP has off-loaded legal development tasks to private firms and, using the case of the online retailer Taobao, shows how firms create rule of law in a weak legal environment. Xiaojun Li and Meg Rithmire both look at the role of firms in shaping Chinas internationalization. Li (with Ka Zheng) uses a unique survey of Chinese manufacturing firms to understand their motivations for joining (or not joining) projects as a part of Chinas One Belt One Road initiative. Rithmire looks at outward investments of firms of all types of ownership to argue that going global has attenuated the power of the CCP by facilitating corrupt asset expatriation. "
Suzanne E. Scoggins,State Control in Unexpected Places and Unexpected Ways: Lessons from China ,"The Chinese state is a vast bureaucracy that oversees many aspects of society, but state control is about more than just streamlining infrastructure projects, promoting economic development, or clamping down on dissent. This panel looks at how the Chinese state is exercising control in unexpected places and unexpected ways. Two of the papers explore state intervention in areas of society where the government has seemingly little interest. Fang investigates the ways in which Chinas propaganda apparatus is censoring and shaping pop culture content, while Hans paper looks at state influence over the production and consumption of internet novels. Both papers demonstrate how the state is moving deeper into cultural territory through censorship and the promotion of content that invokes national themes. The remaining papers investigate exercises of state control in China that run counter to our expectations. Scoggins details the efficacy of public relations campaigns implemented by the police bureaucracy to offset the agencys increasingly contentious relationship with the public, and Yao taps into new sources to show how state agents mitigated cultural heritage destruction during the Cultural Revolution. Taken together, these papers present a varied portrait of the Chinese state that reveal much about state priorities and behavior when it comes to controlling the cultural narrative and the image of the state. "
Carlos Yu-Kai Lin,Teaching Chinese Literature as World Literature: Lu Xun as an Exemplar ,"One of the foremost writers in early twentieth-century China, Lu Xun is widely known for his literary works that delineate and reformulate the national spirit of Chinese people. However, to what extent can we read his works as an example that illuminates the study of world literature, which emphasizes the long-standing phenomenon of transcultural and translational practices? A hundred years have passed since Lu Xun published his A Madmans Diary (1918), arguably the first modern Chinese fiction that inspired the entire May Fourth generation and beyond. What does it mean to study and teach Lu Xun in the English-speaking world during the twenty-first century in which we are faced with an ever increasing demand for a dialogue between disciplines and fields of studies? In particular, how can Lu Xuns works shed light on the relation between world and national literatures, the connection between personal memory and national narrative, and the conversations between Sinophone studies and Chinese literature? These are the questions that this roundtable aims to explore. Christopher Lupke addresses the question of why teaching Lu Xun is essential to world literary studies and explores the possibility of teaching Lu Xun from an interdisciplinary perspective. Jon von Kowallis discusses the translations of Lu Xuns classical-style poetry in both Chinese and English-speaking contexts. Ping Zhu analyzes issues related to gender and colonial modernity in Lu Xuns works and reveals their pedagogical implications. Nick Admussen examines ways in which Lu Xuns Wild Grass can be taught by emphasizing the works aesthetic, psychological, and political implications. Carlos Yu-Kai Lin highlights the role of Lu Xun as a literary historian whose works exemplify how a modern, Western literary form is built into and fascinated by local materials. Alexa Alice Joubin will chair the roundtable and make closing remarks on the inseparability of the studies of world and national literatures. "
Joshua L. Freeman,"Minority Elites and the Early Maoist State: Cooperation, Accommodation and ","While the 1949 establishment of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) has long been seen as the central dividing line in twentieth-century Chinese history, recent research has demonstrated important continuities in many spheres of life between Republican and Maoist China. These continuities were often especially notable in minority areas, where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) typically had little presence before 1949, and was thus reliant on pre-revolutionary local elites for much of the 1950s. This panel will explore these crucial cooperative relationships referred to as the United Front between the CCP and indigenous elites in Chinese minority regions and borderlands. Scholars have rarely considered the United Front as more than cynical expediency. Yet, as Lyman Van Slyke noted, by 1949 the United Front had developed from tactic to strategy to ideology. The United Front had become fundamental to the framework through which the CCP and minority communities understood and interacted with each other, as the party sought to inculcate Maoist ideology and local elites worked to retain their own influence. Ranging from Chinas southwestern borderlands to the Tibetan Plateau to the Muslim regions of the far northwest, members of this panel will outline the formation, functioning and significance of United Front alliances between the CCP and pre-revolutionary minority elites, and will examine how these partnerships ultimately disintegrated under the strain of Maoist radicalization. The panel will provide a fresh perspective on the establishment of Party rule in borderland regions and the integration of minority communities into the emerging structures of the PRC. "
Wayne Soon,"Winning Hearts, Minds, and Bodies in Communist China ","Scholars have examined the history of medicine and the body in Communist China by unpacking the relationship between Traditional Chinese Medicine and biomedicine as well as between diseases and society. This panel seeks to re-center the critical role that communist ideology played in persuading the Chinese people that a revolutionary China required new modes of healing, consumption, mobilization, and maintenance of the body. Although efforts at nurturing new behaviors were often disrupted by unexpected agents such as fortune tellers, Overseas Chinese, canteen operators, and medical personnel, their opposition was attenuated by the affective regime of Communism, which constrained their resistance toward new regimes of biopower. Through four case studies, this panel will show how communism necessitated a fundamental reorientation of the individual body to its surroundings. Mary Augusta Brazelton will examine how immunization became a significant site of conflict between the state and people over the implementation of government policies in the early PRC. Wayne Soon will investigate how the Overseas Chinese introduced a global and cosmopolitan form of biomedicine in wartime Yanan, challenging the nativist and nationalist rhetoric that colored existing understandings of medicine and society in the region. Emily Baum will show how the Communists sought to curb fortune-telling practices by replacing individual forms of spirituality with a Party-sanctioned materialism. Seung-joon Lee will present on the history of food politics in the early PRC, revealing how the use of canteens in the Kuomintang period continued to haunt similar efforts at mobilizing nutritional standards by the Communists. "
Hedda  FlatÃ¸,Chinese Climate Change and Environment: Government and Citizen Reactions and ,"This panel looks at governmental and public reactions to climate change and pollution in China: To what extent do citizens wish their local government prioritizes environmental protection, and what factors influence such demand? Where does the public engagement for environmental protection come from? Compared to other priorities such as public goods provision, how strong is the public desire for environmental protection? What are provincial level governments doing to curb GHG emissions and tackle pollution? Which effects has the revised Environmental Protection Law (2015) which strengthens both administrative measures as well as citizen participation, had in provincial jurisdictions? While it is often reported that Chinese local governments environmental protection enforcement is poor, the situation of addressing climate change and curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is not equally dismal. What can explain GHG mitigation without the implementation gap? Current environmental reactions and interactions are shaping Chinese society and politics in ways we do not yet fully understand. In order to illuminate the mechanisms and dynamics that occur within this domain, this panel invites papers which systematically and empirically address aspects of environmental governance from the perspectives of those who govern, and of the affected population. "
Ching Kwan Lee,Hong Kong as a Postcolony: Twenty Years of Chinese Rule ,"Postcolonial Hong Kong is a world historic experiment on the co-existence between a liberal capitalist society and its authoritarian communist sovereign. The past two decades of Hong Kong- Mainland integration and contention have inspired popular fears of recolonization or internal colonization, by China, but also new passion and imagination among the younger generation and civil society activists about Hong Kongs political future. The 2014 Umbrella Movement, in which 1.2 million citizens participated in the 79-day occupy movement in downtown Hong Kong, was just the tip of an iceberg. This watershed event was both the culmination and the source of deep- seated institutional, political and economic conflicts and struggles involving different segments of Hong Kong society, the Hong Kong Government, and Beijings proxies in the territory. Taking stock of twenty years of momentous change, this panel analyzes Hong Kongs postcolonial transformation under Chinese rule in four key arenas: political economy, rule of law, migration, and cultural production. Together, the papers address these questions --  Do Chinas economic interests in Hong Kong conflict with its political imperatives of control? Why has rule of law become an intensely contested terrain in Hong Kong-Mainland relation, and with what consequences for Hong Kongs political economic future? How are Mainland Chinese migrants to Hong Kong racialized and ethnicized, spurring an anti-immigrant nativist movement? How has the Hong Kong film industry navigated its integration with the Chinese market, with what consequences for Hong Kongs cultural production and identity? "
Felix A. Boecking,Translating Classical Texts of Political Economy and International Law into Chinese ,"This panel adopts a dual, text-centred and biographical approach to the intellectual history of the introduction of concepts of Western political economy and international law into China. Importantly, it gives agency to translators. All of the translators considered were important scholars in their own right. All of them made important choices in their translation, and, through their translations, shaped the modern Chinese vocabulary. The panel engages with a series of questions most fundamentally, what is a translation? Is it a recreation of a text? How much linguistic innovation is a standard part of translation? Or, in other words, are these translations unusual? The panel also considers the biographical influences on translations, by asking how life stories affect translation projects. How does one translate texts about capitalist/early capitalist societies into a language which is based in a country which is not a capitalist society? What is the role of the translator? What are the particular challenges of translating a text into Chinese? Also, does the translation of a text change over time, and how does the environment for translating such texts change over time? What do the translations show about the translators understandings of political economy and, later, economics? Suns paper advances the study of translations of Wheatons Elements of International Law beyond the standard accounts of WAP Martins translation; Karls paper explores the feminist roots of the first Chinese translation of Das Kapital, and Boeckings paper shows how, even in 2001, Smith gave authority to debates aboute the role of prices. "
Benjamin  Bogin,The Second Buddha: New Perspectives on Padmasambhava ,"This panel concerns literary and artistic traditions surrounding the legendary eighth-century tantric master, Padmasambhava. This culture heros mythology began in Tibet and the eastern Himalayas, where he is conceived of as a second Buddha, in some ways more powerful or important than the historical Buddha. His importance to the cultural life of Asia is vast - whether measured by the geographic distance between sacred sites devoted to him in Tibet, Mongolia, China, Nepal, Bhutan, and India or by the hundreds of volumes of literature recounting his life and teachings.  His portrayals in art date from at least the thirteenth century, shortly followed by his earliest literary description as the second Buddha.  At present, he is one of the most globally recognizable figures in Tibetan iconography. The participants in this panel focus on a diverse set of texts, images, narratives, histories and built structures related to Padmasambhava. Elena Pakhoutova investigates the purposes and functions of visual narratives about Padmasambhava in the Himalayas, which incorporate earlier elements of popular Buddhist narrative. Lewis Doney addresses the impact of the earliest Padmasambhava biography on the stratification of Inner Asian Buddhist societies. Daniel A. Hirshberg explains the manifestations of Padmasambhava in liturgy, hagiography and iconography within the context of Tibetan Buddhist tantric traditions. Benjamin Bogin explores the construction of temples representing Padmasambhavas palace in Tibet, Nepal, and the United States. Together, these papers offer insight into the cultural dynamics surrounding one of the most important and understudied figures in the history of Buddhist Asia. "
Christopher Rea,China Vice: Defining and Dealing with the Modern Criminal Element ,"This panel explores the concept and experience of criminality in modern China. It looks at how authorities have defined certain activities as criminal and prosecuted them, as well as how such activities have been experienced by community members and other local actors. Kidnappers, crooks, pornographers, and swindlers: papers examine four archetypical criminal types and why they mattered from the perspectives of state and society between the late Qing and the early Mao era. Quinn Javers shows why communities and officials resorted to or supported kidnapping in late Qing Sichuan; while proscribed by statute, this form of illegal justice had both material and didactic effects. Weiting Guo focuses on how villagers in Zhejiang participated in gambling, opium consumption, and violence, as well as in campaigns against such villainy. Yvon Wang examines to what extent so-called yellow, or pornographic, print material survived Mao era campaigns against it, highlighting significant continuities in how licentiousness was regulated across the 1949 divide. Christopher Rea shows how and why the Maoist party-state became obsessed with swindlers, imposters, and spies infiltrating the revolutionary ranks in the 1950s, going so far as to mobilize writers to churn out stories about con men. Each study draws on archival sources to reveal tensions between individual expediency (e.g., detaining a debtor), market demand (e.g., for opium or gambling), social stability (e.g., campaigns against frauds), and ideological imperatives (e.g., to ban licentious materials). Taken together, they reveal the contested and ever-shifting bounds of vice and criminality in modern China. "
Griet M. Vankeerberghen,Commoner Mobility in the Early Chinese Empires ,"This panel investigates, for Chinas late pre-imperial and early imperial period, the social, cultural, and geographical dimensions of commoner mobility.  Whereas the role of travel by high officials and generals in the constitution of the early empires is generally understood, other groups too should be considered.  Our panel has two interrelated scholarly aims.  First, it will shine the spotlight on the mobility of groups of commoners scribes, members of the lower orders, soldiers, conscripts, or merchants to try to determine to what extent their mobility was free or was restricted by government mandates and regulations, and to gage the impact of private and professional mobility on the lives of the commoners who were on the move.  Second, as a focused examination of a concrete, but complex, historical topic, the panel will make a case for the importance of integrating diverse source bases.  Excavated texts (including legal sources) are of crucial importance to understand a topic such as commoner mobility. However, they need to be weighted critically, and brought into dialogue with one another, with transmitted texts, and with the human landscape of early China.   This is a difficult and complex task, that requires reflection and cooperation among scholars. Each presentation will be short, and focused both on an aspect of commoner travel and a particular source base, so as to allow the kind of dialogue, among panelists and with the audience, we think is necessary to move the field of early Chinese history forward. "
Shana Ye,"Red Love and Love Red: Gendered, Sexualized and Affective Linkages of Socialist ","Accounts of Chinas social transformation often presume a rupture between socialism and postsocialism. This narrative simplifies complex power struggles between the state and the mass, erases revolutionary agency of socialism, and serves to justify the dominance of neoliberal ideology. To challenge this narrative, the panel explores dynamic relations between socialist history and postsocialist present through the lens of gender, sexuality and affect. Drawing from recent debate on the usage of FunÃ_, Xin Huang analyzes how historical legacy of Mao-era womens liberation, has contradictorily shaped current feminist movements in China. Tracing various attitudes towards womens menstruation leave in the 1950-60s and the present, Yiyu Tian views menstruation as an affective site where women utilize their body as creative strategies to negotiate with state power. Shana Ye explores the queer potential of reconstructing narrative of sexual violence into radical politics of resistance by providing a close reading of a memoir by a gay man who was prosecuted in the Cultural Revolution. Charlie Zhang brings the issue of affect and queerness to the transpacific level. Linking the ascendancy of Peter Le with queer entrepreneurial strategies used by Chinese (gay) men, he provides a new understanding of value creation and extraction in the age of transnational neoliberalism dependent on circulation driven by expectations, rather than production and consumption. Together, the papers search for a robust critical language to contest the Cold-War informed neoliberal construction of socialist China, and explore new possibilities of gendered agency from the past to shed light on todays struggle. "
Jeffrey R. Tharsen,Digital Methods for Traditional Chinese Literary Studies ,"Recent advances in the field of digital humanities applied to Chinese literary studies have led to the creation of new methodologies designed to exploit the full potential of digital source materials and computational technologies. The papers to be presented in this panel have been specifically selected to highlight four different digital sinological methodologies, each centered upon a new digital corpus developed by the presenter. Drawn from articles to be included in a forthcoming special edition of the Journal of Chinese Literature and Culture, this panel will demonstrate the benefits of a variety of computational methods in the analysis of premodern Chinese literary practices. Jeffrey Tharsens paper is centered upon comparative linguistic and phonorhetorical analyses and visualizations of parallel passages in the early Chinese works Zuozhuan and Guoyu. Evan Nicoll-Johnsons paper demonstrates how network analyses can provide a more in-depth picture of reading practices and the circulation of books and documents during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Mariana Zorkinas paper is focused on a corpus-linguistics analysis of specific clichs and their use throughout Tang literature. Wang Zhaopeng will present his five-year statistical study of the geographical distribution and displacement of Tang-Song poets, based on text mining of commentaries and secondary sources. We are particularly grateful to Cai Zong-Qi, one of the worlds foremost experts in premodern Chinese literary analysis, and Liu Chao-Lin, one of sinologys most renowned digital humanists, for agreeing to serve as discussants for this panel. "
Victor Seow,"Of Reds and Experts: Socialist Science, Technology, and Medicine in Maoist China ","Recent scholarship in the history of Chinese science, technology, and medicine has rewritten the failure narrative that had previously characterized accounts of scientific endeavors in Maoist China. Rather than dismissing the period as being entirely inhospitable to the scientific enterprise, this work has demonstrated ways in which individuals from citizen masses to professional experts participated in the making of science under socialism. From grassroots medicine and fish farming to agricultural mechanization and coal mining, our panel showcases attempts by different circles of experts papered and otherwise to adopt and adapt science to the ideological, material, and environmental constraints of the socialist state. Gross explores how rural medicine emerged as distinct from professional and state-sponsored medicine, demonstrating that the spectrum of political positions within the Party was also reflected in on-the-ground medical practices. Jiang traces how aquaculture experts justified their research in genetic and embryological science otherwise classified as bourgeois by framing this work in Marxist terms, and laid the foundation for future successes in fish farming. Rogaski examines, through the case of Beidahuang, how socialist dreams of landscape transformation through technological inputs were thwarted by the treachery of terrain. And Seow looks at how the impulse to compete with capitalist countries in industrial output kept thermal efficiency low even as more and more coal was being extracted and consumed by the socialist machine. Together, these papers highlight the tensions between ideology and expertise, state and society, and visions and reality that underpinned the making of socialist science in the Peoples Republic. "
Liana Chen,"Connoisseur-Researchers, Musical Notations and the Shengping Shu Archive: ","The birth of modern studies of xiqu (Chinese song-drama) as a discipline occurred in a pivotal moment in early twentieth-century China. The global competitions over collecting and interpreting theatre-related materials prompted Chinese researchers to reexamine the place of xiqu in the Chinese cultural tradition and among world civilizations. This panel examines how the emerging modern studies of xiqu were shaped by new interpretive methodologies, an expanding conception of study materials and the availability of previously unseen performance materials.  Panelists will investigate three distinct cases in which early Republican-era scholars and artists evaluated and used study materials as they established and expanded the studies of xiqu in new directions. Hsiao-Chun Wu examines the studies of Qi Rushan and other scholars to show how Chinese intellectuals emphasis on collecting as scientific method of humanistic research motivated drama scholars to explore a wider basis of research materials for knowledge production. Dongshin Chang explores how a shared common vision to promote kunqu domestically and globally motivated early Republican scholars and artists to revamp the system of musical notation. Liana Chen establishes the Shengping shu archive as the key element to early Republican scholars effort in documenting the artistic legacy of the Chinese imperial theatre. Professor Shana Brown of University of Hawaii at Manoa, an expert on modern Chinese intellectual history, will serve as the panel discussant. We suggest that specific methods of collecting and studying xiqu led to the creation of Chinese drama studies as a field of knowledge in the early Republican era. "
Fangyi Cheng,After Conquest Dynasties ,"Scholars usually consider the differences between conquest dynasties and native dynasties in Chinese history as diminishing through the process of Sinicization, or simply had been obliterated by the subsequent native dynasties. Following this perspective through the entire course of Chinese history, the reign of conquest dynasties could be considered as a detour, especially in terms of political history. This panel wants to debate this viewpoint by investigating the legacy of conquest dynasties through the lens of those native dynasties behind them. Sanping Chen first discusses the Xianbei legacy of assistant conquerors in the Tang Dynasty by comparing different conquest dynasties with an emphasis on the Xianbei regimes. With a focus on the context of rituals, Zhan Beibei then looks into an early Ming imperial marriage ritual case to analyze the underlying Mongol legacy in the Ming court. Francesca Fiaschetti investigates the dynastic succession during Yuan-Ming to discuss the practical aspects (such as military, economical) of Mongol legacy in the East Asia during Ming era. Fangyi Cheng closes the panel with a discussion on the evolution of Sinicization theory applied in different contexts by both Chinese and Western scholars in late 19th and 20th Centuries. By looking at dynastic alternations in terms of legacy rather than ""transition"", the panel demonstrates the significance of the conquest dynasties in Chinese history is often downplayed, and highlights elements of mutual influence between strategies of government in China and Inner Asia. It thus reviews the position of China in the broader context of Eurasian history. "
Enhua Zhang,Digital China: Decenter and Deconstruction ,"This panel examines the digitization in and of Chinese culture in the new millennium. It concerns but is not limited to the following issues: how do digital techniques transform the social reality and create new ways of representation? Particularly, how are various sectors of culture reshaped by the arrival and dissemination of digital technology? What role does digitization play in negotiating the form, content, politics, and ethics in different ramifications of culture? Song Shis paper investigates how digital media and communication technologies are used to empower Chinese NGOs. Andy Rodekohr considers how digital filmmaking and CGI-enhanced cinematic spectacles have transformed the imagination of the the masses in contemporary China. Enhua Zhang tackles the issues of digitization and dramatization, memory and anesthesia, private and public revolving around three recent films digital recreation of Tiananmen Square. Based on the India-born Indranis The Legend of Lady White Snake, Liang Luo presents the digitization of Chinese culture in the transnational context and questions the relationship between digital-ness and plasticity, subject-making and metamorphosis. As a whole, this panel demonstrates the multifaceted use of digital technology in the spectacular construction of film, memory, performances, and social change. The four papers also each engage with the concept of marginalization: queer mentality and intermedial experimentation in Luos paper, marginalized grassroots NGOs in Songs paper, the anachronistic notion of the masses in Andys paper, and, in Zhangs case, the the resonance of individual memory in the face of state-sanctioned mythmaking. "
Huiying Chen,Mobility and Materiality in Early Modern China ,"This panel examines the ways in which mobility has shaped the meanings assigned to objects and knowledge in early modern China. Mobility and materiality have been studied extensively on their own, but rarely together. Materials are connected to the meaning of place, but those meanings are destabilized by trade and travel; goods contain value and knowledge, but these are problematized by strategies for transport and government censorship. This panel shows how different kinds of mobility transformed materiality and meaning. Anne Gerritsen explores how mobility and transience shaped the material record of the ceramics trade town of Wuchengzhen. Huiying Chen discusses the commodification of local products in eighteenth-century China, asking how the movement of travelers followed and redefined the meaning for a local delicacy the Jinhua Ham. Following jade from Xinjiang to Beijing, Yulian Wu examines how its materiality shaped transport tools and methods and Qing strategies of labor mobilization. Xue Zhang elucidates how duplicates of Jesuit maps were transmitted, uncovering a longstanding struggle between the diffusion and concealment of knowledge in nineteenth-century China. In different ways, these papers show that the movement of goods, regardless of whether this occurs through trade, travel, government transport, or knowledge transmission has had a transformative impact on the meaning of those goods. At the same time, the various modes of mobility are shaped by the materiality of the goods. We seek to show, therefore, that the interaction of materiality and mobility plays a key role in meaning-making and identity formulation in early modern China. "
Petrus Liu,Postsocializing Queer Desires in China ,"Scholars of Chinese sexualities generally attribute the emergence of gay identities and communities in China to the end of socialism. However, the precise relation between Chinas sexual and economic liberalization remains unclear, especially since both postsocialism and gay identity remain controversial terms. While some critics challenge an unproblematic narrative of queer emancipation by exposing the neoliberal drive of pink economies as the true basis of contemporary LGBT visibility, others insist that the socialist legacy has been repurposed rather than abandoned by transnational capitalism. At the same time, newly available archives and oral histories of the Cultural Revolution produce a much more nuanced understanding of Chinas socialist regulations of bodies, pleasures, and sexual behavior than a simple repression/liberation model. This panel brings together divergent disciplinary methodologies (history, sociology, literature, and media studies) and clashing perspectives to build a dialogue around the relation between Chinas evolving political economy and sexual culture. "
Yue  Zhang,"Late Imperial Chinese Commentaries Across the Jing (classics), Shi (history), Zi ","Commentaries often expound on the meanings of words and passages, discuss styles and techniques, speculate authorial intentions, offer commentators evaluations, and thus influence readers interpretations of texts. Commentaries are thus crucial to our comprehension of the substance and significance of texts. In late imperial China, a huge number of commentaries appeared across four traditional bibliographical categories: jing (classics), shi (history), zi (master works), and ji (collected works). This panel elucidates late imperial Chinese commentaries in light of the following questions: what similarities and differences do commenting practices share in these four categories? How do commentaries shape the status of these works, and thus influence our understanding and reading of them? Pauli Tashima examines the jing section, explaining how pingdian contributed to canonical scholarship on the Zuo Tradition. Qin Fang explores the shi section, investigating the means by which poetic comments help construct and establish local history through a reading of the Haichang shenglan. Ji Hao explores the zi section, explicating the commentarial approaches that have led to various understandings of the nature of the novel Xi Youji. Lastly, Yue Zhang delves into the ji section, exploring Shen Deqians poetry anthology Gushi yuan by examining how Shens comments affect later readers understanding of literary style and status of Six Dynasties poets. The four papers place commentaries in larger historical and intellectual contexts, contributing to a better comprehension of the tradition of commentaries and their significance in influencing the meaning and status of the main texts. "
Nicolai Volland,Chinas Cosmopolitan Traditions ,"Modern Chinese literature has been intertwined with the world beyond Chinas borders in manifold ways. The cosmopolitan outlook of literary texts from the May Fourth period, the 1930s, and the 1980s, is generally acknowledged. Much less widely known are the efforts, of writers and readers alike, to engage the world during other periods, such as the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Cultural Revolution. Commitment to worldliness, however, was not restricted to isolated periods in Chinese literary history. Rather, its entanglement with global literary and cultural currents from the widest variety of sources is arguably one of the foundational features of modern Chinese literature. To probe this long tradition of interest in and commitment to literature and culture from abroad, this panel brings together papers that trace the cosmopolitan traditions of modern Chinese cultural production at some of its crucial junctions. Building on careful examinations of understudied texts and little known sources, the papers explore instances of worldliness such as Sino-Soviet theatrical exchanges in the 1950s, the Chinese career of an epic French novel, the consumption of foreign films during the Cultural Revolution, and the reception of Beat Generation literature in the 1960s and 1970s. Modern Chinas engagement with world literature and culture, the papers demonstrate, has given rise to a rich body of cosmopolitan traditions outward looking in conviction but by no means monolithic or uniform that have made Chinese literature and culture a truly global enterprise. "
Donglai Shi,"Comparative Yellow Perilisms: Imagination, Reaction, and Continuation ","The rise of China in the 21st century has engendered a new wave of China Threat theory, which is often reminiscent of the Western discourse on the Yellow Peril popular in the early 20th century. In this context, studies on the ideology of Yellow Perilism have gained a renewed sense of political contingency. However, a careful examination of recent academic publications on the Yellow Peril reveals that the critique of Orientalism is still the dominant methodology used (Mel Chen 2012, Ruth Mayer 2013, John Kuo Wei Tchen and Dylan Yeats 2013, Christopher Frayling 2014, Madeline Hsu 2017). To counter this ongoing postcolonial obsession with the West, this panel proposes a comparative turn to study the Yellow Peril discourse as a set of interconnected and transnational phenomena across the long 20th century. Wendy Gan and Amy Matthewsons papers on the intertwinements between Chinoiserie and war in fin de siÃ¨cle British literary and visual culture bring in a broader view to go beyond the established tropes of Asian invasion and racial contamination, while Tobias Metzler examines the Japanese and Chinese reactions to Western Yellow Perilisms through analyses of historical government documents. The session will end with Xiaojian Zhaos paper on anti-Chinese sentiments in Italy, and together with the discussant Flairs Donglai Shis comments on the adaptions of the yellow peril discourse in China, contemporary continuations and mutations of the racist discourse will be put into comparative perspectives with its precedents in international cultural history. "
Chialan Sharon Wang,Multifarious Modernities in the Cold War Sinophone Literature and Film from ,"During the Cold War, the 1949 divide brought about both divergent institutionalizations of national culture and corresponding counternarratives or subcultures in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. While the diaspora of and communication among cultural agents within and outside these regions gave rise to heterogeneous national imaginaries, cultural activities, and socio-economic practices, the literary and film productions within these diverse loci envisioned different yet intertwined Chinese modernities. This panel aims to generate discussions on the way the Cold War Sinophone cultural productions throw up discrepant, antagonistic, sympathetic, or complicit ideological positions and cultural-economic relations across boundaries. Hsiu-Chuang Deppman delves into the gender politics in Eileen Changs Little Reunion and thinks about how its generic indeterminacy allows the writer to contest social norms at both local and global levels. Chialan Sharon Wang investigates the ambivalent Taiwanese national consciousness and palimpsest meaning-making processes in Zhong Lihes and Zhong Zhaozhengs novels and their later film adaptations. Jessica Tsui-yan Li looks into Zhong Xiaoyangs novel, Stopping by the Roadside and its film adaptation, A Pinwheel Without Wind, to unpack the notion of colonial modernity and examine the way ideological binaries are challenged in the Cold War Hong Kong cultural arena. Also foregrounding the obscured ideological oppositions in the urban films of Cold War Hong Kong, Lawrence Zi-QiaoYang scrutinizes the emergence of corporeal plasticity and immaterial labor in conjunction with the development of modern infrastructure, media, and technology in both pro-Taipei and pro-Beijing film productions. "
H. Christoph Steinhardt,Peering Through the Fog of Censorship: Studying Protest and Repression in China ,"What do we know about protests in China? Surprisingly much and, at the same time, very little. We know a great deal about micro-dynamics why protests emerge, how they are coordinated, what makes their success or failure likely, and how the state defuses or represses them. We know little, however, about the big picture. What is the distribution of protests over space, time and contentious domains? How do state responses vary over issues, tactics and social contexts? How have protester behavior and repression evolved? In contrast to previous times, when demonstrations were almost completely blacked out from the Chinese public sphere, the Internet, social media and even the Chinese press have over recent years brought to light an unprecedented amount of information about contentious events that researchers can exploit to answer these questions. To initiate a discussion on this new body of evidence, this panel brings together junior and senior scholars from three continents who are working with media-based protest event data sets Chen Chih-jou (Academia Sinica) examines what kinds of threats are most prone to trigger state coercion, and how protest policing has evolved over time. Manfred Elfstrom (Harvard) compares government responses to workers protests across ownership type. Li Yao (Harvard) and Manfred Elfstrom (Harvard) examine the link between coercive capacity and coercive application. Finally, Christoph Steinhardt (CUHK) and Christian GÃ¶bel (Vienna) shed light on the biases and validity of media-based protest event data. Kevin OBrien (Berkeley) will provide comments. "
Ling  Kang,"Techniques of Speaking: Sonic Intermediality in Republican China, Taiwan, and the ","The sonic modernity of the twentieth century Sinosphere features an explosion of the techniques of speaking, listening, and silencing with which the operation of political propaganda, mass education, and cultural authority became effective and affective. Sitting in the intersection of sound studies, media archaeology, and history of technology, this panel interrogates the fundamental practice of speaking in the trans-medial environment of Republican China, colonial Taiwan, and the PRC. It seeks to understand how different techniques and technologies of speaking shaped the subject positions and collective identities of speakers, listeners, and readers. Starting with Republican China, Thorn Chens analysis of the multimedial lecture-screening identifies a shift of authority in the mass education from the speakers verbal diction to the global logistics of technical images. Laura Wen investigates the newspaper accounts of hassei eiga and their promotion of talkie screenings in colonial Taiwan, revealing the intricate relationship between modern media, technological cosmopolitanism, and colonial propaganda. Moving along, Ling Kang probes into the sonic technology in PRC films to de-fetishize the mass voice as a source of political and moral legitimacy in the socialist discourse. On the same vector, Yu Wangs paper traces the coming-into-being of the prototypical socialist voice manifested in the speaking manner of Chinese radio announcers in a Cold War context. Discussing lantern slides, newspaper, film, radio broadcasting, and human voice(s), this panel reconsiders the media and remediation of speaking on different structural and infrastructural levels such to historicize the heteroglossia of the modern Chinese soundscape and its cultural-political ramifications. "
Tim Pringle,Changing Labour - Advocacy and Workers Agency in China ,"The panel draws on a rich vein of existing labour studies in China hitherto chiefly focused on manufacturing in Guangdong. We include the province but breach the borders of the great southern silo in three places. First, the panel spans four different industries across three sectors.  Second, the geographical range of the research reaches from Chengdu (shoes) to Beijing and Shanghai (construction) and sanitation in Guangzhou. Third, the panel moves away from well-researched state-society relations to the agency of workers themselves. The panel papers do not ignore the importance of recent significant legal and policy changes in state-(civil) society relations, but rather locate these developments in a dynamic and dialectical interaction with the the forces of labour to borrow from Beverly Silvers (2003) famous phrase. The big idea for this panel is that workers own actions lie at the heart of effective labour advocacy in whatever form. While far from original, the idea gains layers of complexity and tougher challenges in the context of well-known constraints on labour organising in China. The panellists hail from four universities in three countries with a gender balance favouring female participants. It is an interdisciplinary panel drawn from sociology, development studies and industrial relations and includes early career, established academics and a PhD candidate with an established publication record.  It is chaired by the Editor of China Quarterly. The discussant is a practitioner from an influential international labour rights advocacy organisation whose academic research focuses on labour in China. "
Zhan  Zhang,Life Along the Silk Road ,"This panel aims to challenge the image of the so-called Silk Road, which usually highlights trade, especially long-distance trade, as its defining element. Such an oversimplification does not do justice to the complexities of local life. The Silk Road was not like a railway, where only the destinations and the cargo matter. Local affairs, we emphasize, were always peoples main concern, whereas the constant flow of goods, people, and ideas, often a byproduct of political turmoil, formed the backdrop of the societies along the Silk Road. Examining contracts, legal records, religious art, and military communications from Khotan, Kucha, Turfan, and Dunhuang, panelists will participate in a conversation led by the chair and discussant to discuss the roles of law, finance, military, and religion in and beyond the local communities at these four key sites on the Silk Road. We may hold a discussion and not give the usual 20-minute talks. Examining Tibetan military communications from Khotan, Chen Shen discusses the impact of the Tibetan occupation in Khotan. Based on a new edition of Khotanese documents, Zhan Zhang shows how Sogdians participated in the Khotanese taxation system as creditors. Analyzing contracts and legal records concerning slaves from Dunhuang and Turfan, Cuilan Liu discusses the legal implications of Buddhist monks and nuns involvement in the slave trade as buyers, sellers, and witnesses to transactions. Examining Buddhist paintings in Kucha, Monika Zin argues why visual images found on the Silk Road do not always reflect daily life. "
Jing  Wang,Technologies of the Sublimed Self: Socio-technical Formations and Re-,"Technologies have been conceptualized as a major dynamic in shaping and transforming the economic, political, and cultural status quo in East Asia. Meanwhile, many argue that the affordances of technologies have always been fulfilled within the existing social or institutional structures. The idea of socio-technical formations (e.g., Sassen 2012), however, emphasizes the ways in which interactions and collaborations between the social and technological factors engender new forms of identities, mechanism of governance, and social relations. Focusing on the booming business and financial fields in East Asia, this panel examines and contrasts how the ensemble of social and technological transformations has redefined the process of subjectivization in historically or culturally specific contexts. This innovative and interdisciplinary session will present various technological artifacts, interfaces, or interactive experiences obtained from our ethnographic works and engaged with economics or sociological concepts. Based on the history of semiconductor industry in Taiwan since the early 1990s, Lin examines the development of communication technologies and the formation of nationalistic identities among the high-tech workers in Hsinchu Science Park. Zhang depicts the new entrepreneurial work imaginaries among IT entrepreneurs in Beijings High-Tech Zone, situating them in Chinas post-socialist reform since the late 1970s. Wang studies the small individual investors in Shanghai using digital financial technologies to construct their new economic and social identities in and beyond the cyberspace. Finally, Kim conceptualizes financial subjectivities in South Korea after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, and studies how a specific trading technique influences individual perceptions of wealth, value and investment. "
Ghassan Moazzin,"Risky Businesses: Banking, Insurance, and the Emergence of Modern Risk ","From the 19th century, the Chinese market attracted growing numbers of foreign companies. Such firms not only brought new business forms into China, but also new notions of risk - no longer based on personal experience, but increasingly built on statistical evidence and quantified in numbers, tables and graphs. The introduction of this new understanding of risk created new risk-related knowledge about China, the creation of new business strategies for dealing with risk and the establishment of the first insurance companies in China. While measuring, assessing and dealing with different forms of risk became critical in the operations of both modern foreign and Chinese businesses since the 19th century, it has received little attention from historians. This panel addresses this research lacuna by exploring how modern concepts of risk were introduced and localized in China. By reconstructing the operations of foreign and Chinese businesses in two critical sectors banking and insurance this panels papers collectively show how firms in China found new ways to quantify and manage different kinds of risk and adapt European conceptualisations of risk to existing Chinese conditions. While the panel demonstrates how China became part of the evolving global risk network that sought to find uniform standards for assessing risk, it also stresses the role Chinese actors and local conditions played in shaping these standards. More broadly, this panel engages with key issues in the history of law, economy, business, and science, bringing a global perspective to a subject traditionally studied through the lens of Sino-foreign competition. "
Lala Zuo,Digital Humanities and New Directions in Studying East Asian Art and Architecture ,"This panel presents four original digital humanities projects that enhance learning, researching, and exhibiting Asian art and architecture for the first time. In addition to seeking international and interdisciplinary collaborations with other scholars, each panelist employs digital technologies and methods, including automated computation, 3D scanning and modeling, and virtual reality, to reimagine the built environment. Li uses a formal tool in architecture and design called shape grammar to define portions of the Yingzao fashi, a Song dynasty (960-1279) court architectural manual central to the modern study of traditional Chinese architecture, as algorithms. Zhang will introduce a digital research database of historical buildings in China. His presentation considers new analytical technologies, challenges in terms of scholarly productivity, and ethical and security issues tied to digital databases. Morita will reassess the International Dunhuang Project as a Digital Humanities tool and introduce its potential for reconstructing art and archaeological sites by utilizing recent achievements in North America. Lastly, Harrer will focus on the visual recovery project of the Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) and evaluate its potential for advancement in preservation theory against the exclusive appreciation of the age value. The panel is followed by a discussion led by two discussants. Nagakura, an architect and director of computation group with MIT Architecture, will comment on the technology aspects of these projects. Miller will discuss these projects from an art historical perspective and explore new directions in East Asian art and architectural history with the increasing availability of digital tools. "
Rainier Lanselle,Intralingual Translation as an Approach to Yuan-Ming Period Textual Practices ,"Under the combined pressure from a new, emerging readership and the consciousness of the diglossic nature of written Chinese, the Yuan-Ming period witnesses the flourishing of a set of textual practices that share a propensity to find new ways of preserving and transmitting textual meaning in new social and discursive environments, while creating modern forms of expression. The concept of intralingual translation is a valuable approach that reveals the unity behind very diverse textual practices, and sheds light into the fundamentally linguistic component that underlie many textual endeavors characterized by such a need for resemantization. As a relatively new concept in the field of East Asian studies, intralingual translation is the object of the first presentation by Lanselle, which reviews some of its theoretical hypotheses, as well as the reasons for which their validity applies to the specific environment of the Yuan-Ming. The following three contributions each explore different facets of this language-related epistemic reconfiguration. Bisettos paper focuses on an example of Yuan yanyi commentary that stresses the intrinsic continuity between commentary and translation (or auto-communication), in relation with the notion of context. Vetrov points out the importance of vernacularization as a pervasive presence that affects the very condition of philosophical expression in thinkers who, like Wang Yangming, are in search of language accuracy. Sibaus paper illustrates how, in the context of literary creation, intralingual translation plays a major role in the reshaping of textual sources in literary Sinitic. These contributions are part of an international venture currently underway. "
Kyle A. Jaros,The State of the State: Inside (and Outside) Chinas Changing Governmental ,"Recent scholarship and media reports point to a dramatic recentralization of power in China following the ascent of Xi Jinping. Though there is something to this narrative, the realities of central-local relations in China remain complex and regionally varied. This panel explores the changing governance roles and relationships of actors at different levels of the political system, addressing several related questions: What was the status quo ante of intergovernmental relations with which Chinas current cast of leaders had to grapple? How has the intergovernmental and state-society distribution of policymaking authority and resources shifted over the past decade? How should we conceptualize the relationship between Chinas political power structure and its governance architecture?  To answer these questions, panelists examine different tiers of Chinas governmental hierarchy - central, provincial, and sub-provincial - and the institutions that mediate central-local and state-society relations. The four papers highlight the mixed and sometimes counterintuitive ways political centralization affects subnational governance patterns. Maags examines the changing modes of participation by non-state actors in Chinas multilevel policymaking system using evidence from multiple localities. Wilson examines the changing personnel dynamics of municipal government during an era of conflicting economic and political pressures. Jaros and Tan highlight the resurgent development role of provincial governments at a time when much attention is focused on local economic actors and central institutions. Finally, Donaldson draws on fresh empirical evidence to adjudicate among competing theories of central-provincial power relations in China. "
Tian S. Liang,The Layered Body in Art: From Late Imperial to Contemporary China ,"In visual studies, scholars have studied how the body has been ritualized, gendered, dispersed and inscribed. Building on the above research, this panel considers the layered quality of the body in China from late imperial to contemporary times. We argue its layered nature invites new investigations about its susceptibility to immediate surroundings, clothing-body relationship, its medical and anthropocentric properties in connection to sexuality, physiology and emotion. Focusing on the plasticity of the body, we question not only the individuals relationship with the body and self, but also with the bodys metaphors and analogies, subjectivities, and sociability. Li explores how the banana leaf represents an exterior layer of the female body that illuminates intersections of sexual and Buddhist visions of the body. Looking at the garment as a temporal layer of the body in Qing imperial paintings, Rado reconsiders how the iconography of Chinese dress enabled the imperial body to transcend the boundaries of time. Liang examines to what extent art-anatomical books infiltrated a layered, medical gaze of the body in public debates in the early twentieth century. Focusing on a group of figure sculptures by the contemporary artist Xiang Jing, Ngan details the process by which Xiang used skin as a porous layer to materialize the genderless nature of human soul. Together the papers investigate boundaries between nature, culture and artifice .  Our discussant, Richard Vinograd, a distinguished scholar on visual representations of Chinese body, and our chair Lee Talbot, an expert of Chinese textiles, will enhance discussions of the papers. "
Jianqing  Chen,New Media Technologies and Literary Worlding in Post-Socialist China ,"his panel investigates the intersection between new media technologies and the making of literary worlds in post-socialist China (1978-present), pivoting on two complementary lines of thinking. Firstly, how do ideas and forms associated with or generated by media technologies impact narratives and styles of literary representation? Secondly, how do technological artefacts and media systems facilitate certain modes of literary creation, circulation, and consumption?  Drawing on theoretical approaches in media and literary studies, this panel explores how digital media technologies empower Chinese netizens creativity within popular literary production. While Shao Yanjun and Xiqing Zheng focus on fans deployment of digital technologies to create a participatory literary subculture that circumvents state sponsorship and censorship, Jianqing Chen and Renren Yang canvass the power of media gadgets to forge specific styles of reading and writing. Shaos historicization of the rise of Chinese web-based fiction suggests a grassroots mode of making world literature via transnational and translingual flows of netizen labor. Zheng positions online platforms as an alternative space for fanfic prosumers to reconstruct forgotten revolutionary memories. Chen explores the impact of scrollable digital screens on the physiognomy of the narrative prose delivered therein. Yang examines a type of celebrity authorship that emerges from the structural homology between the operation of Chinas online serialization system and the progression of an action/adventure fantasy. Finally, Heather Inwood will lead a discussion on the role of the digital in so-called new media and the much-debated literariness of online fiction while opening the floor for audience participation. "
Judith T. Zeitlin,Voice/Sound Studies in the China Field: Part I ,"Sound and Voice Studies are having their moment now as the acoustic turn has opened up new materials, questions, and methods. Despite some impressive recent efforts, Sound Studies, and especially Voice Studies remain emergent fields in China and tend to cluster along predictable historical and disciplinary lines. This double-panel seeks to jumpstart cross-disciplinary dialogue on voice and sound by bringing together scholars from a broad range of disciplines (music, history of science and technology, literature, film and media studies, history, and anthropology) and by bridging the divide between the advent of mechanically recorded sound. This first panel examines three radically different ways of conceptualizing the human voice at three distinct historical moments. Yiren Zhengs paper approaches the whistling of third-century intellectuals and hermits described in literary texts as a limit case that situates the voice in the gap between language, music, nature, and human agency. Judith Zeitlins study of the Qing physician Xu Dachun treats his practical, non-textual approach to singing pedagogy as a kind of techne(craft, art, technology), which instrumentalizes the body of the singer yet which exalts the operatic voice as a utopian  link to the music of antiquity. Eileen Chows paper turns from voice as sonic object to song as cultural biography. Tracing the story of an anthem composed in the 1940s for martyrs executed by the KMT as it travels from the Mainland to Taiwan and through different media over time, she emphasizes the power and meanings a song accrues through revoicing in different contexts. "
Daniel  Knorr,Transregional Perspectives on the Taiping War and Tongzhi Restoration ,"The Taiping War looms large in any survey of modern Chinese history. Naturally, scholars focus on the Jiangnan region in particular to explain the legacies of this period, and recent scholarship has further deepened our understanding of the scars left on this area. However, because of its magnitude and geographic breadth, the effects of the war rippled across the empire. This panel will examine the Taiping War and subsequent Tongzhi Restoration from a transregional perspective. On the one hand, this means bringing attention to the experiences of regions that scholars have generally neglected or appear to have been only peripheral players in this conflict. This will enable us both to speak more authoritatively about common experiences across regions and to explain how and why local histories diverge from common narratives about the war and its aftermath. On the other hand, our panel will address the circulation of people and ideas through locales and around the empire. This is especially important in the case of the Taiping War and Tongzhi Restoration because the fighting both disrupted existing networks of exchange and created new ones. Moreover, the aftermath of the war saw the emergence of not only local activism, but also a growing sphere of elite activity on a national scale. By attending to translocal connections during the 1850s and 1860s, we can better explain the relationship between these two trends, which affected social and political developments in the last decades of the Qing. "
Stephanie Su,"Old Story, New Imaginations: Transmedial Representation of the past in ","Representations of history underwent dramatic changes with the development of new media and Chinas revolutionary demands since the turn of the twentieth century. Knowledge of the past was constantly reappropriated and repackaged through transmedial circulations in response to nation building and the modernization process. In what way did the medium challenge, limit or liberate historical imaginations? This panel explores representations of the past across visual and literary media, highlighting the interconnectedness among various forms of historical narratives throughout different stages of revolution in China from the 1920s to the 1960s. The papers in this panel investigate visual, theatrical, cinematic, textual works to illuminate the creativity and fluidity in the interplay between media in representing the past. Stephanie Sus analysis of Li Yishis history painting elaborates the cinematic quality of Lis work, which was concurrent with the emerging history films in the late 1920s, as demonstrated in Yan Yuqians paper. Lis visual representation stimulated public debates on historical authenticity, particularly from Lu Xun, who also retold ancient stories. Satoru Hashimotos discussion on Old Stories Retold reveals Lu Xuns attempt at using the modern medium of fiction, particularly its rhetoric of irony, to make sense of historical rupture at Chinas modernization. Yan Yuqians case study canvasses the connections between cinema and drama, which was transformed again in wartime China. Wang Pus paper probes into the appropriation of antiquity for socialist agenda, arguing that the transmutability of allegorical-anachronistic energies indicates that media were a site of crisis and mediation during the Cultural Revolution. "
Judith T. Zeitlin,Voice/Sound Studies in the China Field: Part II ,"This second part of the double panel shifts the focus from voice to sound. The four studies in this section all look at ways in which the power of sound technology is deployed to shape political space(s), from the Qing imperial court to Old Shanghai, and from the entirety of the Peoples Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution, to local communities in contemporary Taipei. The forms of technology the papers explore are equally varied and include innovation in pitch pipe measurement and a Jesuit-built organ at the Kangxi court,  commercial production, distribution, and marketing of musical records, state-issued loudspeakers and portable record players, scientific instruments for measuring sound decibels, and private audio-visual recordings.  Pursuing different methods of inquiry historical, musicological, ethnographic, technical, aesthetic the papers are careful not to impute agency to technology alone but rather raise important questions about social actors and their motives in mapping, defining, controlling, consuming, and contesting the audible world. In so doing they also develop important conceptualizations of the acoustic problems they address: territorialization and saturation (Laurence Coderre), selective memory (Andreas Steen), mediation on a global-historical scale (Zhuqing (Lester) Hu), and a technologically aspirationla approach to noise (Jennifer Hsieh). "
Mian Chen,The Origins of the Chinese Propaganda State (1937-1965) ,"This panel examines how the Communists and Nationalists built up their propaganda states so as to create intellectual fashions and transform their citizens.  Unlike other literature treating propaganda as simply ideology-inspired and self-designed rhetoric, this panel reveals how the propaganda campaigns emerged, developed, and institutionalized when the political regimes competed with and were influenced by antagonistic forces and cultures. Situating propaganda campaigns on various political settings and cultural landscapes - the Communist-controlled regions, the Nationalists-governed areas, the Japanese surrounded foreign concessions, the British colonial Hong Kong, and some cross-border spaces -- papers of this penal provide a thought- provocative comparison of different origins, discourses, apparatuses, and management of propaganda as well as the efforts of cultural workers to use propaganda to serve their political objectives. Shuge Wei scrutinizes how Sino-Japanese war shaped Nationalists propaganda system. Shensi Yi analyzes the two parties propaganda competition during the civil war. Bixiao He re-examines the little-known Hong Kong origin of the Peoples Republic of China(PRC)s private press policy. Mian Chen discusses the Communists clandestine Guangdong-Hong Kong propaganda link from 1945 to 1965. As this panel tries to emphasize, the Chinese propaganda states were woven into national and global politics and were shaped by bloody wars as well as underground networks. "
Xiaofei  Kang,"Gender, Local Identity, Public Space, and Art Patronage:  New Dimensions in ","Composed of four original studies based on new primary sources and innovative approaches, this panel explores several aspects of Chinese religion from the Ming to the present times. Despite their thematic diversity, these four studies share in their investigative focus and analysis of religion in China from the Ming to contemporary China. Secularization and its various forms from localization, socialization, through gendered modernization, and politicization of religion are explored in these new studies. Wangs paper explores the process of localization of the Pure and Bright Daoism first founded by Xu Xun during the Eastern Jin era through a locally driven cultic movement centered on a network of temples in Jiangxi. Liu reconstructs a history of Daoist patronage and practice of elite arts at a local temple in Nanyang, and finds Daoist artistic patronage practice empowering its monastic activism in shaping and assisting the social and political transformation in local society of late Qing Nanyang. Kang examines the Communist partys deployment of gender in both its anti-superstition campaigns and in its myth-making propaganda about the Partys ascending mandate and legitimacy in the late 1940s. Chaos study examines how temple-organized ritual processions not only negotiated and maintained social relations among their constituent neighborhoods, but they also helped open up tightly controlled public space for cultural and local dissent under the strictures of the authoritarian Martial Law regime in the pre-1980 Taiwan. "
Sheng-Wen Tseng,"Green Energy, Economic Development and Environmental Governance in China ","This panel is organized by five scholars, including Taiwan and Germany, and discusses several issues in four papers including solar and wind power in Shandong, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Our papers aim at exploring the research question: How did China make a balance between the development of green energy, economic development, and environmental governance? Our papers have the following findings. First, our papers observed that the green energy investment and industrial structure change did help to improve the energy efficiency and energy portfolio during the 11th Five-Year Plan and the 12th Five-Year Plan periods in Inner Mongolia. Second, our papers also found that owing to the bundled environmental policies from the central government, local governments and green company in Inner Mongolia and Shandong formulate different pattern in wind power development. Third, our papers discovered that the PV panel sectors were later embraced by the Chinese government as part of a set of industrial policies dedicated to new emerging strategic industries and an overall attempt to an increase of renewable energy use. As a result, China has emerged as a major producer of solar panels and modules as well as a major investor in solar PV installations at home. Finally, our papers realized that central government targets calling upon local governments to increase their installed capacity for wind energy and therefore now it has been substituted with targets to consume the generated power, causing local governments to attract high energy consuming industries to their regions, causing further environmental problems. "
Wendy Leutert,Shades of Red: Reinterpreting Chinas Early Reform and Opening Period ,"This panel challenges current interpretations about the politics of Chinas early reform and opening period. In Problems with Factions in Chinese Politics: the Case of Chen Yun, Joseph Torigian goes beyond the conventional factions account of the periods elite politics, leveraging new historical sources to reinterpret Chen Yuns relationship to Deng and his role in early economic reform policies. More broadly, the paper critiques the utility of a factions approach to understanding the elite politics of this period. In Mobilizing for Reform: Policy Experimentation and Implementation in Chinas State-owned Economy, Wendy Leutert analyzes the appropriation and creative adaptation of Mao-era mass mobilization efforts to advance market-oriented enterprise reforms. Drawing on enterprise and State Council records, she analyzes campaigns in three state firms from the 1980s through the 1990s. In China and the World Bank in the Post-Bretton Woods and Early Reform Period,"" Federico Pachetti demonstrates that the domestic political economy of Chinas early reforms cannot be understood without analyzing its international dimension and specifically Chinas evolving relationship with international financial institutions. Using previously unexamined materials from the World Bank Archives and Chinese published sources he demonstrates how Chinas historic decision to rejoin the World Bank in 1980 catalyzed exchanges of ideas and information, ultimately reshaping both China and the international economic system. "
Graham Chamness,Making and Faking Place at Chinese Literary Gatherings ,"This panel explores the way literary gatherings and representations of those gatherings have variously imagined, shaped, and playfully reconfigured ideas of place (and time) in pre-modern China. We use the term literary gathering as a convenience to refer to elite social gatherings which served as occasions of literary production and whose occasions became the subject of literary and visual representations. Literary gatherings are manifold in East Asias cultural past. This panel measures the impact of some of these gatherings on Chinas past and offers reflections on different methodologies for their future study in China and beyond. Our papers reflect a diversity of disciplinary approaches to literary gatherings across a span of time from the fourth to the sixteenth century. Graham Chamness (PhD candidate, Harvard University) adopts an intellectual-history perspective in his examination of the fluidity of place in poems composed at a poetry composition game in fourth-century southern China. Kay Duffy (PhD candidate, Princeton University) explores the socio-ritual dimensions of a spring festival used for holding literary gatherings in the third through sixth centuries. Benjamin Ridgway (Assistant Professor of Chinese, University of Puget Sound) conducts a literary analysis of the changing meaning of scenic sites in poems composed by elites gathering around West Lake (in Hangzhou) during the Northern and Southern Song dynasties (960-1279). Lihong Liu (Assistant Professor of Art History, University of Rochester) investigates the relationship between community and local place in pictorial representations of vicinities of Suzhou produced by scholar-artists of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). "
Mercedes Valmisa,Integrating Chinese Studies and Chinese Philosophy: Problems and New ,"This innovative methodological panel asks how current research in Chinese Studies might inform and positively influence the field of Classical Chinese Philosophy. The panelists, specialists in Comparative and Chinese Philosophy, History, Religion, and Literature, want to challenge the widespread view that notions such as the lack of author and school of thought are necessarily detrimental for pursuing philosophically oriented research. Instead, we consider the integration of textual, literary and historical knowledge in the study of Chinese Philosophy a necessary corrective for both the future of the discipline of Chinese Philosophy and an expanded, post-ethnocentric concept of Philosophy as such. The four speakers use case-studies of primary sources to highlight different aspects of this methodological and ideological issue, and to challenge one another with a clash of perspectives. Csikszentmihalyi opens with the fundamental question of how discourses about Chinese Philosophy can be adjusted to reflect destabilizing ideas such as corporate authorship. Jiang holds that, despite textual studies roles in the interpretation of Chinese Philosophy, the latter must maintain its own disciplinary norms and autonomy. Perkins, on the contrary, argues that new disciplinary norms informed by Chinese Studies will bring new opportunities to the development of Chinese Philosophy. Finally, Brindley explores how acknowledging that research in Chinese Philosophy necessitates multi-disciplinarity can help us conceive an enriched notion of Philosophy. The ten-minute, focused presentations, and the active role of the chair-discussant throughout the panel allow most of the time for discussion, encouraging timely and substantial interactions between panelists and with the audience. "
Tingting Xu,Making It Real: Intercultural and Intermedia Images in Late Imperial and Early ,"The zeal and enthusiasm for verisimilitude taking place in late imperial and early republican art of China is highlighted by a burgeoning interest in the notion of actuality and knowledge-based, or machine-rendered, trustful representations. Instead of indiscriminately applying the western term realism to related art practices, this panel explores a variety of realistic, pseudo-realistic and nominally realistic paintings and photographs produced between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries in China, and opens up to a broad reflection on issues of stylization, canonization and idealization that would contradict the artworks realistic shell. How did the imported realistic approach merge and renew Chinese traditions of nonfictional representation, and how did this merging collaborate or collide with concurrent agendas and strategies of art? While the intersection of realistic representations and mannered, unrealistic elements is the panels focus, all papers address encompassing concerns relevant to intermedia practices and intercultural viewership in this period. Matters raised for discussion include gendered portrait-making practices in Qing court ideology, and the pursuit of spirit-likeness carried by a highly manipulated realistic depiction of the subjects; the conventionalized method of pairing panoramic views with serialized views of scenic spots in landscapes and the depiction of residential gardens; the integration of premodern pictorial vision, studio-based staging, and late-imperial official documentary practices in early Chinese landscape photography; and the stylization of European schemata and techniques of realistic paintings associated with the Chinese call for realism in early twentieth-century. "
Pengfei Zhao,"Displaced Youth: Migration, Education, and the Young Generations in Chinas Post-","From the May Fourth Movement to the present, Chinas youth has always played an important role in transforming the fate of the country. Their migration within and beyond China has powerfully shaped its sociopolitical landscape and reinforced Chinas connections to the world. Drawing upon empirical studies in anthropology, sociology, and education, our panel reveals how youths of different social statuses negotiated the structural and spatial constraints during their migration process in post-Mao China. Tracking the transnational mobility of college-age Chinese students, anthropologist Vanessa Fong (2011) has shown how Chinas youth has been ushered into the global neoliberal system through the education-migration nexus. Our panel pursues scholarly interests in youths of different social statuses and generations, and further reveals the heterogeneity of their migration patterns. Pengfei Zhaos paper examines how re-introducing merit-based examinations at the outset of the post-Mao reform occasioned rural youths transcendence of the rural-urban divide. The other three papers focus on more contemporary experiences: Anita Koo elucidates the strategies employed by the rural youth to increase their employment chances after graduation from urban vocational schools; Lisa Yiu analyzes the identities of rural migrant youth who excelled in urban public schools; Shuning Liu explores the considerations of urban elite youth when they select schools to prepare them for higher education abroad. Together the papers contribute to an interdisciplinary understanding of Chinese youths migration, as it relates to state-market dynamism in the post-Mao era beset by challenges of urbanization and globalization. "
Yuanhao Zhao,"Being Ethnic in China: Representing, Deploying, and Negotiating Hui-ness ","Being ethnic in China involves myriad discourses about individual and group identity and challenges ones competence to switch between discourses in different social-cultural and political contexts. This panel offers four case studies that analyze the ways one Chinese ethnic group, the Huis identity is represented, performed, and negotiated. Each paper focuses on forms and sites of Hui expressive culture to examine the employment of different identification discourses in various spatiotemporal settings. Sue Tuohy examines the ways that Huaer, a genre of folk songs that often is framed as a multi-ethnic genre, becomes represented as a Hui genre through labeling, narratives, and performance practices. Discussing two works written in Arabic and Chinese from the 1920s to 1950s by the Hui intellectual Ma Liangjun, Nakanishi Tatsuya suggests they reflect a switch in identification strategies to speak to different readers. Mario De Grandis analyzes modern Hui fiction writing to demonstrate how Hui authors mange in their literature to demonstrate their ethnic identity within state-approved practices by utilizing ethnic markers to promote their work, and circumvent state surveillance on religious expressions. And Yuanhao Zhao focuses on an aspect of Hui material culture, the ""tangping"" pitcher, examining the ways different agents employ and contextualize the pitcher to serve their own purposes and to highlight particular elements in being a Hui. These presentations examine the creative and artful ways that Hui-ness is represented, negotiated, and employed in the ongoing construction of the Hui ethnic group in China. "
Gerald Roche,Moral Economies of Language in Tibet ,"Language protests have been a consistent feature of Tibetan life in China during the past decade, from self-immolations, to street protests and online petitions. These protests are an intensification of a language activism culture that pervades everyday life in contemporary Tibet, and includes extracurricular education, various forms of creative expression, as well as grassroots corpus and status planning. Previous discussions of Tibetan language politics in both academic and popular forums typically draws on a broader heuristic that portrays protest and resistance in Tibet as a direct and proportional reaction to state-led exclusion, marginalization, and stigmatization. This political economy model of Tibetan action argues that an understanding of Chinese state policies and their implementations is sufficient for understanding Tibetans actions. In this panel, we argue that this approach needs to be complemented by an examination of the moral economies of Tibetan actors: what values and moral reasoning motivate people to make particular linguistic choices, including engaging in language activism? Presenters on this panel anthropologists, linguists, and folklorists discuss the moral logic underlying linguistic activism in Tibet: who participates, for what languages and which language issues, why, and in what ways? In doing so, we not only offer new insights into an important social dynamic in contemporary China, but also offer a new approach to understanding how people make decisions about language. "
Rowena Xiaoqing He,The Unbearable Heaviness of Becoming: Liu Xiaobo and Chinese Political ,"I have no enemies, wrote future Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo in the closing statement for his 2009 trial that he was not allowed to deliver in court. Liu, serving an eleven-year prison term for subverting state power, died on July 13, 2017. Lius death and the tenth anniversary of Charter 08, a citizens manifesto that Liu disseminated and that led to his imprisonment, provide an occasion for reflection. Liu Xiaobos life journey is inseparable from the historical time in which he lived. From a freewheeling literary critic amidst the culture heat and political awakening of the 1980s, to a participant and a peacemaker in the 1989 Tiananmen Movement, and eventually a public intellectual devoted to Chinas peaceful democratic transformation, the last forty years of Lius life epitomized the evolution of political consciousness among Chinese intellectuals and ordinary Chinese citizens since the end of the Cultural Revolution. Lius experience was shaped by the historical context in China; at the same time, he himself became an agent for change. In death as in life, Lius name remains taboo in China. Our interdisciplinary roundtable will engage the audience in discussing Liu Xiaobos personal transformation in parallel with the making of Chinese political consciousness since the Reform Era, and the implications for China and the world. Weiping Cui, professor of Beijing Film Academy, personal friend of Liu Xiaobo, and signatory of Charter 08, will share her perspectives on Liu Xiaobo and 1980s China. Panel organizer Rowena Xiaoqing He, China-born Canadian historian specializing in the Tiananmen Movement, will focus on Liu Xiaobo in 1989; Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, will consider the domestic and international contexts of Charter 08 and Chinas citizens movements. Yujie Chen, Taiwan scholar focusing on criminal justice and human rights developments in Taiwan and China, will bring in her comparative perspectives from the experience of Taiwan.Panel chair Jerome Cohen, professor of Law and a leading expert on Chinese law and government, will suggest how past Chinese experiences inform the present and may influence the future. "
Max D. Woodworth,Speed and Temporality in Asian Urban Development ,"A popular observation of Asias urban development in recent decades is that it is fast. Scholarly literatures have also begun to probe the issue of speed in urban development through the lenses of fast policy (Peck and Theodore, 2015) and fast cities (Datta and Shaban, 2015). This panel takes inspiration from this foundational work and aims to push it in new directions. Specifically, the starting point for the assembled papers is to question ostensibly universal measures of time, speed, and space that underpin much of the scholarship on urban development and that have tended to reproduce understandings of city-making in terms of GDP growth, area size expansion, population statistics, labor force and investment figures, and so forth. Such approaches risk repeating dominant discourses of development while neglecting important insights from anthropology, history, and other fields regarding concurrent multiple temporalities and modernities (Massey, 1999; Woodside). Beginning from discrete ontological critiques of time and speed, this panel is concerned with deepening the ongoing theoretical explorations of these twin dimensions as they pertain to Asias urban development. Papers will, firstly, probe time and speed in their relational complexity with the social and spatial transformations of city spaces, secondly, will bring needed attention to the politics of speed and temporality for various social groups, and finally, will expand these themes with geographically diverse contributions. "
Zeb Raft,Audiences in Imperial China ,"The aim of this panel is to take a wide perspective on the nature and role of audiences in imperial China.  Audience is a manifold concept comprising, at a minimum, the audience a creator imagines for his or her work, the implied audience that emerges from the work itself, and the various actual audiences that perceive the work, either immediately and directly or in other places and future times, and in mediated or partial forms.  Our panel will examine these different dimensions, and the ways different disciplines have addressed them.  Specifically, the panels four case studies will build on recent audience-oriented scholarship in the study of China to address the following topics: What constellations of audience took shape in the fifth century literary imagination?  How did audience expectations influence Song dynasty landscape painting?  In what sense were the interrelated audiences for poetry and painting the same and how did they differ?  How might the modestly literate have perceived writing stylistically oriented toward an implied gentry audience? In keeping with our theme, this panel will have its own audience orientation.  Panelists will begin by very concisely presenting their arguments, or some salient point from their papers.  A short discussion period will follow.  Then, drawing on this audience feedback, participants will discuss a small selection of their primary sources. "
Huijun  Mai,The Meanings of Things: Material Culture in Middle Period China ,"Drawing on a variety of textual, visual, and historical materials, this interdisciplinary panel explores the ways in which the unprecedented interest in material things shaped the structure of knowing and learning in the Song Dynasty (960-1279).The four papers that compose the panel collectively advance two propositions: that the wider cultural changes associated with the Song cannot be understood in insolation from the physical objects that conditioned these changes; and that the history of material culture would be incomplete without consideration of its intellectual, social and aesthetic underpinnings. We progress from literary engagements with things (Huijun Mai and Yunshuang Zhang), through discussions of the material dimensions of textual production (Ya Zuo), to analyses of material processes that occurred independently of writing (Jeffrey Moser). From the biographies of scallops to the mold-marks of bronzes, we move from the wordiest effusions of materiality in the documentary record to the silent things unvoiced in texts. In so doing, we explore the ways in which things, as both subjects and objects, shaped the Song experience. "
Ying  Hu,Filial Daughters in Twentieth-Century China ,"This panel investigates how womens filiality has been re-imagined in twentieth-century China as it intersects with rapidly changing gender roles and the rise of the modern woman. Even as the traditional patriarchal family came under discursive fire in the May-fourth Movement and again in Maos China, filiality as a cultural practice and ethical framework did not disappear. Instead, it underwent significant transformations, reappearing as either a social virtue of care or in the guise of mother-love. Through close analysis of poetry, biography, fiction, award petitions and field research, the four papers demonstrate that daughterly filiality remained potent and operative as Chinese women negotiated between their familial roles and public responsibilities. Some of us focus on the tension between womens pursuit of independence and social demands of elder care; some of us argue that the mother-daughter bond provided affective resources for the constructions of female subjectivity in modern China. As we engage in productive dialogue over this complex topic, it is clear that the lens of filiality allows us to observe fine nuances of womens gendered self-conception at crucial moments in Chinese modernity. Beyond individual case studies, we conceptualize the literary and political articulations of daughters filiality and the depth of its emotional and ethical appeal. "
Clemens  Buettner,"A Military Republic: The Militarization of Chinas State-Building, Nation-Building, ","The Chinese military shaped the Republics history extensively, but not only in the form of warlordism. Its influence on Chinas state and society manifested itself in other complex ways as well: (1) Many Chinese military men were professional soldiers who had been trained to acquire a specific set of values, virtues, and behavioral patterns - and their actions were motivated by it. (2) The Republican state- and nation-building projects were characterized by strong militaristic inclinations that depicted the military man as the engine of modernization, the symbol of strong nation-statehood, and the embodiment of the qualities desired in the Republican citizen. Certain notions of professionalism and militaristic images thus amalgamated in ways that emboldened the Chinese soldier to assert his influence in areas beyond his original area of expertise. This panel argues that the actual extent to which the Chinese military influenced Republican state-building, nation-building, and modernization efforts can only be grasped when the methodologies and theoretical considerations of the fields of warlordism, militarism, and military professionalism are combined. Together, they can provide systemic insights in institutional and organizational factors that facilitated the socio-political rise of the military, in the dynamics of civil-military relations, in the preponderance of military values and considerations, and in the soldiers (self)-image, modes of thinking, conduct, and action. Each paper of this panel applies this multi-methodological approach, respectively focusing on reasons for military interference in politics, civic education in military academies, military substrata of Chinas material culture, and the armed forces obsession with modernity. "
Joshua  Eisenman,Red Chinas Green Revolution: Agricultural Modernization and Collective ,"This panel examines how changes in remuneration incentives and the spread of agricultural techniques, in particular, land terracing, increased productivity in Mao era China. Marc Blecher will chair the panel and serve as discussant. Sigrid Schmalzer will begin with a presentation on the history of terracing in Maoist China. Her paper will address how local knowledge was tapped and new technologies and techniques were successfully disseminated. Chinas research and extension system integrated land and laborsaving capital improvements and technical innovations and rewarded locally appropriate, results-driven investments. Joshua Eisenmans paper reveals how the commune extracted an increasing percentage of household savings to finance investments in productive capital and technology via this integrated research and extension system, thus kick-starting a continuous development process that produced rapid growth in food production. The workpoint remuneration system attracted members attention toward the size of their own portion relative to others and away from the extraction of their savings - a process he calls commune kabuki. Huaiyin Lis paper challenges the conventional wisdom that there was widespread shirking and inefficiency in agricultural production under the workpoint remuneration system. Li re-examines the issue of work incentives and how they constrained and motivated Chinese villagers participating in collective production. He explains the influence of non-institutional factors (i.e., local geography, demography and ecological conditions), and informal institutions (i.e., indigenous social networks, communal norms and collective sanction) on the structure of collective organization, income distribution and extraction. "
James  Flath,Beyond the Velvet Rope: The Role of Labor in Making Chinas Heritage Sites ,"It is widely accepted that heritage is a construct, built and assembled from bits and pieces of material remains and immaterial memories to create a version of the past that satisfies modern needs and desires. But how is heritage actually made? Who are the builders and assemblers? How much of heritage is accidental, and how much planned? Heritage enterprises, even those celebrating labor, tend to draw a distinction between labor and leisure. Heritage work is typically done after hours, behind closed doors, or in fenced off areas that are closed for renovation. By obscuring the role of labor in making heritage, its managers help to preserve the mystique of heritage as eternal and natural, existing somehow independent of the human touch. Recently, however, there has been an upsurge of interest in craftsmanship and the individuals who make heritage possible. These papers contribute to this emerging understanding of heritage as something that is made every day. Elizabeth Lawrence investigates the West Lake Five Year Plan of the 1950s, explaining how socialist labor management became essential to the continuity of a scenic site traditionally associated with leisure and gentility. James Flath explores that Hanyang Iron Works, where labor productivity has been replaced by a post-industrial chic culture and creative park that nonetheless claims labor as heritage. Lisheng Zhangs study peels back the surface of the Jianchuan Museum Complex to examine who does the work of creating museums and how their labor is managed. "
Zhiyi  Yang,Cultural Traditions and Political Legitimacy in Occupied China ,"This panel investigates the uses and abuses of cultural traditions for justifying or challenging rights of governance in Japanese-occupied China. After it swiftly conquered large swaths of Chinese territory, Japan faced the challenge of political legitimization. The cultural traditions of East Asia were thus co-opted into its wartime strategies and propaganda. The Chinese client regimes, notably, were all led by classically-educated men, who also attempted to advance their own interests, often by adopting the same Pan-Asianist rhetoric while subtly alternating its meaning. This interdisciplinary panel presents four case studies. Haosheng YANG examines the adaptations and revisions of Chinese, Japanese, and Western musical and cultural traditions in the production, performance, and reception of popular music, which created an ambiguous ethnic Manchukuo (1932-45) identity. SEKI Tomohide examines the character of the much-neglected East Hebei Autonomous Council (1935-38) through its leader Chi Zongmos Confucian idealism. YUAN Yidan argues that the revival of Late Qing discourse in occupied Beijing (1937-45) in effect reflected a contest among individual memory, collective memory, and Japanese propaganda. Zhiyi YANG examines the poetic exchanges around a painting on Jing Ke, a legendary assassin, to argue that the Wang regime at Nanjing (1940-45) exploited historical memory and lyric romanticism to build a community of feelings, which supplemented their institutional weakness. In summary, through music, philosophy, historiography, and literature, the client regimes responded to the crisis in legitimacy by creative appropriations of native cultural traditions to construct new senses of identity under occupation. "
Ling  Zhang,"Landscape, Cityscape, and Soundscape: Cold-War Literary Cosmopolitanism and ","The Cold War era has often been associated with isolation, blockage, hostility and ideological bipolarity: even current discussion of Cold War cultural cosmopolitanism and internationalism tend to concentrate on urban regions and exclude artistic practices bridging spaces and media. Our panel revisits this critical period from literary and audiovisual perspectives in order to highlight a circulatory cultural network that transcends such ostensible binaries such as rural and urban, local and global, Left and Right, and mental and manual labor. By exploring a set of literary institutions, intertextual discourses, and Chinese writers attempts to transcend these boundaries, we reveal the multilayered historical dimensions of cosmopolitanism and internationalism in and beyond China from the 1940s to 1960s.  Zhange Ni studies how Catholic woman writer Su Xuelin negotiates her nationalist sentiments, Catholic identity, and cosmopolitan ideal through rewriting stories of Ming-Qing transition in the 1940s. Hui Xiao surveys the 1956-1966 issues of a Shanghai-based journal Budding and identifies a collective literary imagination that links local and global. Xiang Hes account of socialist writer Ru Zhijuans Lilies (1958) and The Warmth of Spring (1959) investigates the role of traditional ethical values in sustaining a life-and-death struggle and reorganizing urban space. Ling Zhangs paper examines Taiwanese leftwing writer Chen Yingzhens white terror trilogy from the perspective of acoustic memory, aiming to delineate the relations between literary soundscape, landscape, and third world internationalism. Our panel makes a contribution to the field by highlighting the intertextual and transnational cultural exchanges in spite of the Bamboo and Iron Curtain. "
Emily E. Wilcox,Remapping National Form: Center and Periphery in Artistic Canons in Socialist ,"Over the past decade, the expansion of Sinophone studies has brought increased attention within the modern Chinese studies field to artistic activities outside traditionally hegemonic centers of Chinese culture. Most notably, new research on artistic and literary production by ethnic minorities, overseas or diasporic communities, and rural people or migrants have helped to decenter the conventional centrality of Han, PRC, and urban perspectives. In this panel, we extend this approach to consider how the margins have shaped the centers in multiple ways, especially in the construction of national forms (minzu xingshi), or aesthetic practices that became state-sanctioned embodiments of Chinese culture during the socialist era. The panel focuses on the 1940s wartime period and the early PRC, examining the shifting nature and relationships of center and periphery in the formation of newly emergent artistic canons that achieved the status of socialist national forms. Each paper tackles these questions within a different artistic medium: Emily Wilcox shows how a third-generation Cantonese Trinidadian dancer, Dai Ailian, pioneered the development of Chinese dance; Charlotte DEvelyn investigates imagined references to Mongol or grassland themes in canonized musical repertoires of solo compositions for erhu; Christine Ho examines the tensions of regional inclusion and global ambition in the search for national forms in vernacular designed surfaces; and Anne Rebull analyzes the negotiations between rural representation and urban power in the filmic circulation of regional dialect xiqu plays. Overall, the papers interrogate the idea that center-periphery relations are either inherently binary or characterized by fixed power relations. "
Rebecca Doran,Hearing Womens Voices: Meaning-Making and Misinterpretation of Female-,"In recent decades, scholars working across diverse disciplines have increasingly recognized the importance of gender as a socio-historically and politically significant marker influencing womens participation in different modes of cultural production as well as how those contributions were evaluated. Our panel brings together four papers that explore the diverse, and at times quite ingenious, ways in which women occupying various social roles in medieval China have fashioned for themselves meaningful modes of expression both textual and non-textual or challenged how womens voices have been ascribed delimited meanings in male-centric discourse. Rebecca Dorans paper examines examples of fuyao (ornamentation anomaly) that criticize fashions created by negatively evaluated women leaders, approaching these narratives in terms of attitudes to personal ornamentation as a communicator of identity and fuyao as a category of sumptuary regulation. Hu Qiuleis paper analyzes the dubious claims made in 4th and 5th century anecdotal literature about female authorship of pentasyllabic poetry during the late Han and early Six Dynasties period, questioning whether these attributions are less about historical reality than the exigences of later male-centered poetic practices. Wangling Jinghuas paper similarly engages issues of female authorship and anthologization, examining the practice, contributions, and erasure of the poetic voices of female entertainers within the male-dominated poetic world of the late Tang. Finally, Alexei Ditters paper looks at rare examples of female-authored muzhiming in the early Tang, and how these compositions inform us, in their own words, about womens role in the construction of memory and their experiences of death. "
Natasha Heller,Creating Communities in Modern Chinese Religious Life ,"Our panel intends to examine Chinese religious communities in a variety of cultural contexts, so as to both engage with and contest existing models of community building. By comparing diverse modes of religious community in our case studies, we will address questions such as the identities of people who construct representations of religious communities, the indigenous and external origins of such ideas, similarities and differences between them, and their reception among outsiders. The paper by Kao Ya-ning explores how Zhuang shamans (mostly women) form religious communities through spiritual, professional and client networks, including the creation of ritual families. Ideas of family also lie at the core of Paul Katzs paper, which focuses on how modern lay Buddhists envisioned the familys role in building Buddhist communities and engaging with (or rejecting) non-Buddhist ones. The paper by Nikolas Broy analyzes how the Yiguandao (Way of Pervading Unity) strives to create a community of Dao followers via discourse and practice, which resembles Buddhism in extending to families, congregations, society, and the globe. Natasha Hellers paper assesses how Taiwanese textbooks represent religions role in community formation, viewing religious institutions and practices as valuable in terms of fostering common values yet downplaying their spiritual aspects. Papers will be limited to 15 minutes to allow sufficient time for our discussant (Raoul Birnbaum) to suggest key issues in the study of religious community formation and maintenance, as well as the panelists and audience to consider these issues in conversation. "
Chunmei Du,"Reexamining Cold War Politics in China Behind Front Lines, 1940s-1950s ","Political, diplomatic, and military histories have long been the center of Cold War studies in the United States and China. Existing research relies largely on central government documents, and is mainly concerned with American and the Soviet influence in Chinese civil war, especially the roles of political parties and figures, diplomatic exchanges, and military strategies. This roundtable discusses new approaches and sources in the study of Cold War politics in China in the 1940s-1950s. Participants focus on how socio-cultural forces have helped shape war and its memories, using less-known or less-used primary sources. In particular, Zhiguo Yang shows that the U.S. military authorities in Qingdao were more occupied by handing daily incidents involving U.S. military personnel and Chinese civilians than supporting the Nationalist defense against encroaching Communist forces. Chunmei Du examines American military sexual violence and romance embodied in the Chinese jeep girls, focusing on how race, gender, sexuality, and class affected the daily interactions of GIs and Chinese urban civilians after World War II. Matthew Johnson introduces less visible political units and military activities including espionage and counter-espionage, clandestine propaganda campaigns, and other suasion and influence operations, to reveal complex interactions between military forces and society. Xiaobing Li suggests that Chinese and Soviet militaries in the 1950s were not only political institutes obsessed with military technologies, but also social and cultural institutes thatbelieved military modernization was part of their ongoing social revolution and political consolidation. Following the four mini-presentations, participants will first compare their discoveries with each other and discuss how their approaches differ from more traditional historiography. They will then invite audience for a dialogue, and share their extensive archival experience in mainland China, Taiwan, and the United States especially on new opportunities and challenges. For example, how to make more effective use of newly digitized municipal archives in China in the middle of tightening political control? How to better navigate the over-general index and search system in the National Archives and American military archives? The roundtable will be useful for a variety of scholars interested in Chinese history, Cold War studies, and archival research. "
Eric Ping Hung Li,"Art, Design, Cultural Identity and Politics: Understanding Contemporary Social ","This multidisciplinary panel aims to connect latest academic dialogue between arts and design, cultural identity and politics. The four presenters in this panel will showcase their works on Chinese diaspora (Chinese-Canadian) regarding their identity reconfiguration and politics in the globally connected Chinese cultural landscape and in the multicultural society of Canada. The recent economic development not only turns China into one of the super powers in the global economy but also transforming the cultural landscape and the stereotypes within and outside the nation-states geographical boundary. It is evident that artists/designers often use different visual artefacts and representations (e.g., image, symbol, object) to express ideas, inner feelings, past experiences and worldviews. In other words, the creative arts can be used as a form of expression and communication. The proposed AAS panel and the four presentations seek to address the following questions: How do Chinese Canadians use different art forms and designs to express themselves and connect with others? How do Chinese Canadians consume design products such as fashion/clothing to negotiate, (re)construct, and (re)define their identity over the course of acculturation and assimilation? What role do ethnic art and cultural festivals play in a multicultural society? Are there any connections and similarities among the visual arts and designs between Canada and Greater China (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan)? In summary, it is reasonable to suggest that art and design play a very important role in shaping and fostering the socio-cultural values of a society (e.g., Clavier and Kauppienen, 2014; DiMaggio and FernÃ¡ndez-Kelly, 2015; Martiniello, 2015; Martiniello and Lafleur, 2008; Salzbrunn, 2014; Vanderwaeren, 2014). In order to understand the inner feeling, outward manifestation, and personal experience of ethnic minorities, scholars have used art and design as a vehicle to examine and illuminate different issues related to ethnic identity, cultural diversity, and transcultural values. "
Shu Yang,Women Were There - and Then? Gender Transformation on and Behind the Socialist ,"The concern of recuperative feminist historians to put women back into history as participants might seem irrelevant to socialist China. From the early years of the Peoples Republic, women were publicly declared an indispensable part of the workforce and the upholders of half the socialist sky. Yet the official boasts regarding womens presence and liberation are unsettling. They arrogantly covered up serious and specific questions such as: Which women were there? Where were they specifically? In what ways were they presenting themselves or being presented? For how long were they made visible? What were the womens perceptions of their presence? This socialist gender panel completes and complicates those moments in womens participation in socialist China. The papers examine different forms of womens presence and the various gestures women adopted and/or adapted in their encounter with an era that was both empowering and constraining for them. While Lunpeng Ma analyzes iconography and female subjectivity through womens screen presence as socialist exemplars, Daisy Du focuses on real socialist professional women off the screen through her research on Shanghai animation studio. Shu Yang and Mi Zhao question the states glorious promise of liberation and progress. Shu Yang discusses the rehabilitation of once negative shrewish qualities in constructing Great Leap heroines, revealing how uneasy the mass audience felt towards state strategies on gender reconfiguration. Mi Zhao examines the socialist refashioning of once disparaged singsong girls into revolutionary artists and exposes some womens desire to remain as housewives instead of dedicating themselves to socialist construction. "
Carolyn L. Hsu,Civil Society with Chinese Characteristics: Emerging Forms of Citizen Mobilization ,"In the Xi Jinping era, there is ample evidence that China is heading in the opposite direction of civil society. The government is cracking down on human rights lawyers, jailing activists, and shutting down NGOs. Although these reports are accurate and disturbing, their focus on a few sensational cases may distract us from the ways that ordinary Chinese citizens are becoming empowered, and empowering others, in new ways vis-Ã -vis the state. This panel explores new forms of governmentality emerging in the PRC which allow citizen voice and mobilization. For example, the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province created opportunities for political participation in the affected region that linger on a decade after the disaster. Non-activist lawyers are empowering ordinary citizens to file lawsuits. There are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of domestic NGOs in China, addressing social problems and lobbying the state. Some of these NGOs are partnering with the state to create new citizen empowerment opportunities. These organizations not only provide Chinese citizens new ways to mobilize, but they are going outside of the country to influence civil society in other nations. What kind of civil society is developing in China and (perhaps) being exported to the rest of the world? This panel addresses this question from multiple disciplinary perspectives, including sociology, political science, and anthropology, and it draws upon the scholarship of researchers from China, Canada, and the United States. "
Jeremy Tai,Chinese Dreams Along the Silk Road: Pre-histories of the Belt and Road Initiative ,"Launched in 2013, the PRCs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the nations latest global strategy for staving off economic crisis. Bridging development initiatives pursued across Eurasia since the 1990s, the BRI promises greater economic cooperation among the countries of Asia, Europe, and Africa through infrastructure development and enhanced free trade. For the PRC, interregional economic integration would allow the country to overcome slower economic growth, industrial overcapacity, and rising domestic labor costs. Confronting rising economic protectionism brought on by the 2008 crisis, PRC officials invoke the open spirit of economic and cultural exchange of the ancient Silk Road to foster an imaginary that renaturalizes the flows of neoliberal capitalism. Drawing on radical and conservative Chinese intellectuals writing amidst the global crisis of the 1930s and 1940s, when the collapse of the liberal market economy presented the opportunity to envision new futures for the Chinese nation and world, this panel reflects critically on what is at stake in the PRCs BRI. Jeremy Tai considers how right-wing intellectuals inspired by the American frontier story envisioned overseas Chinese returning to serve as pioneers in Chinas own virgin lands. Ana Maria Candela explores how Cantonese intellectuals drew on accounts of anti-Asian racism from the diaspora to call for the end of a world order organized by a global color line. Qian Zhu investigates how exiled Chinese leftists in Southeast Asia conceptualized a Nations Below Wind anti-colonial global alliance against the unequal distribution of wealth under capitalism and colonialism. "
Yu Zhang,Gender and Christianity in Early-Twentieth Century China ,"The study of Christianity in late imperial and early Republican China has mostly focused on the missionaries. Moving beyond a simplified narrative that Christianity brought modernity to China, or a criticism of beneficent imperialism, this interdisciplinary panel brings the analytical category of gender to provide a nuanced picture how Chinese altered their relations with the church in this transitional historical moment. Focusing on indigenous responses and challenging entrenched paradigms, this panel studies images, texts and practices to (re)examine the ideals, stereotypes, and complicated realities when Christianity took root in modern China, particularly, how Chinese used Christianity to negotiate with traditional boundaries.  Based on her interviews of former missionaries and residents, Sue Gronewold examines the multiple meanings of The Pilgrims Progress (popular at the Door of Hope Mission in Shanghai) for women. William Ma traces the visual and textual appearance and evolution of the Virgin Marys image in China, focusing on how the image simultaneously took feminine roles of a mother, a seductress, and a Confucian model of womanhood. Bin Chen studies the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) in Suzhou to investigate how Protestant schools continued and strengthened traditional rules in Chinese society, particularly gender segregation, and the responses from Chinese students. Yu Zhang examines Dora YÃ_s hymn book Fuxing shige (1909), revealing the overlapping and conflicting identities of a Christian woman from the traditional gentry class who used her faith to cover her private feelings. "
Da  Zheng,"Chinese Writers and Cultural Landscape in Hong Kong, 1949-1997 ","Hong Kong is an intersection where a rich variety of different socio-cultural elements clash, converge, and mingle, resulting in a unique and complex cultural landscape. During the period between 1949 and 1997, Hong Kong served as a dynamic cultural enclave for some Chinese writers who chose to get their works produced and performed there due to political and ideological reasons. These cultural productions deserve our critical attention today. The panel approaches this subject through careful analyses of several selected film and stage productions. Da Zheng studies Lady Precious Stream (1957), with a focus on its language, format, and politics in the making of this film. Karen Kingsburys paper contextualizes Eileen Changs A Tale of Two Wives (1958) in Cold War Hong Kong, analyzing the evolution and reception of that film to show its cultural importance. Wai Luk Lo takes on Yao Kes insightful adaptation of Lu Shuns True Story of Ah Q (1959), and offers a detailed comparative analysis with the narrative structure and viewpoints to reveal the complexity of the film version. Finally, Michael Cheuks paper demonstrates Gao Xingjians influence and relevance to Hong Kong theatre as well as to Hong Kong society at large. He examines Bus Stop and The Other Shore, two of Gaos plays that were staged in Hong Kong before the 1997 handover, illustrating how the playwright managed to construct a reflective theatrical space in the periphery of limited freedom. "
G. Andrew Stuckey,Cultural Institutions Across Modern China ,"Institutions have long been recognized as important vectors in cultural development, change, or stability; in modern China, their power has been pervasive and, at times, oppressive. But how do cultural institutions acquire and exercise their power? And how, if at all, do their influences weaken and dissolve? This panel addresses those questions through studies in the diverse fields of theater, literature, visual art and film, all of which articulate the intricate, shifting antagonisms and alliances among established organizations, emerging networks, and individual agents, and explicate how those relationships propel or obstruct institutional functionality. He focuses on the play Wanshi shibiao to delineate how the National Drama School negotiates between literary, pedagogical and performative spaces during the Sino-Japanese War. Stuckey examines the institutionalization of Lu Xun in the Maoist era, looking specifically at the ways the iconography of Xianglin sao is deployed in an enduring story from the Great Leap period. Tan explores the institutional critique art both realized and imagined of Huang Yong Ping from the 1980s that lay bare the structural codependence between the established and the rebellious. Finally, Yang considers the Beijing Film Academys central role in the film industry of the PRC, especially an unlikely alliance between officialdom and the grassroots. Overall, the institutions construed in the papers are no longer fixed, monolithic entities, but ongoing processes with concepts, paradigms and practices that morph in reaction to particular times and spaces. The core of their power mechanism, this panel suggests, lies in their hybridity, adaptability, and porousness. "
Joseph W. Ho,"Imaged Identities: Technology, Performance, and Visual Imagination in Republican ","The introduction of photography and printing technology radically changed the social, religious, and political landscapes of Republican China. Modern images, whether formed by camera lenses or professional painters, were more widely disseminated in mass media and helped to reshape Chinese identities in 20th century global spaces. This panel examines how photography, poster-making, and other visual propaganda embodied the experiences of Chinese people from various social classes, while also transmitting their makers interpretations of modern society. We seek to examine the ways in which Republican-era images reconfigured individual and collective identities in the contexts of religious encounters, political and social representation, and national salvation. We consider the performative aspects of image production, focusing on technical practices and perceptions that shaped visual representation. In this panel, Joseph W. Ho discusses American missionary visual practices and communications in Republican China, framing intersections between global media technologies and religious imagination in rural Hunan. Lex Jing Lu explores changing appearance standards of male political leaders and how photography replaced Chinese physiognomy, reshaping political masculinity and legitimacy-building displays in the early 20th century. Man-Hei Yip looks at Chinese Protestant propaganda posters in comparison with competing representations of national salvation offered by Nationalist and Communist groups before 1949. Matthew Combs examines social, technological, and commercial developments in the rise of Chinese amateur photography during the 1920s and 1930s. Crossing multiple thematic categories and illuminating rare source materials, this panel applies interdisciplinary methodologies in exploring often-overlooked roles of vision, visibility, and visual production in understanding Chinas recent past. "
Hang Tu,In Search of Autonomy: Chinese Intellectuals Between Politics and Scholarship ,"This panel is committed to rethinking Chinese intellectuals ambivalent stance between politics and scholarship in the post-Mao era. In the beginning of the Reform period, Chinese intellectuals were deeply inspired by Webers call to disarticulate scholarship from political utility to carve out an autonomous space for intellectual exchange. Nevertheless, an iconoclastic impulse traceable to the May Fourth Enlightenment complicated Weberian incrementalism, endowing scholarship with a decisive, even Promethean role as powerful ways of formulating radical politics, inspiring revolutions, and legitimating subversive beliefs. The metamorphosis of Chinese intellectual public space from the eighties to recent times is shaped, if not determined by, these two contradictory beliefs on politics, learning, and morality. Our panel brings together literary critics, intellectual historians, and political scientists to examine the multifaceted aspects of contemporary intellectual debates caught between politics and scholarship. Examining the interplay between Chinas intellectuals, institutionalized scholarship, and the Party-state reveals broader changes underway in intellectual-state relations.  Methodologically speaking, we are interested in the introductions of various -isms, foreign political theories to the post-Mao Chinese intelligentsia and how these theoretical arsenals help Chinese intellectuals develop powerful new discourses in political thought. This attempt goes beyond the mere study of the reception of ideas, and asks the question of how do Chinese scholars use foreign theories to write about their own subject positions between politics and scholarship? More specifically, our case studies reveal the process in which four foreign ideas neo-Kantianism, Straussianism, Schmittian statism, and utopian socialism inspired Chinese intellectuals to develop hybrid political discourses from (neo)liberalism to neo-conservatism. "
Jennifer Eichman,Laying It Out: Late Ming Elite Cultural Productions in a Buddhist Context ,"The unprecedented extent of active lay Buddhist participation during the late Ming has been widely acknowledged yet remains understudied. In particular, this panel discusses the incorporation of Buddhist ideas, art, literary works, and ritual practices within literati culture of the time. In their Buddhist-infused cultural productions, literati developed their own particular interpretations of, and rejected, reinterpreted, expanded, or incorporated various aspects of Pure Land and Chan meditation, exegeses, and ritual to create a meaningful overlay not always aligned with received monastic practices. Each paper examines a different instance of late Ming Buddhist culture through material, artistic, dramatic, and exegetical media by which literati articulated their own positions vis-Ã -vis the dominant monastic paradigm. These four works are: a printed edition of the Diamond Sutra augmented with commentaries and illustrations for lay readers, a scroll painting used for lay meditative practice; a play that highlights the religious explorations of a playwright who, in the end, choses Buddhism over its religious competitors, and a textual commentary that reconciles Pure Land and Chan ideas partly through Wang Yangmings brand of Confucianism. Specifically, they all demonstrate how the creative repackaging of Chan texts and concepts of meditation, and arguments surrounding Pure Land rebirth broadened exposure to Buddhist ideas by inserting them in areas of literati culture where they might not otherwise have taken root and changed them in ways attuned to the cultural sphere in which each was created. "
Liying Sun,Moral Responses to Cultural Production in Modern China ,"Modern Chinese literature and film are often studied for their political, aesthetic, or commercial dimensions, but cultural production in modern China has also consistently raised significant moral issues related to social change, generation conflict, and globalization. This panel looks specifically at how literary and cinematic works in different eras (Republican, socialist, postsocialist) have given rise to debates about right and wrong, or helped to build or transform ethical value systems.  Proceeding chronologically, the panel will start with a paper by Liying Sun dealing with the introduction of Hollywood movies into China in the 1920s. She shows how these movies gave rise to moral debate about love, sex, gender, and filial piety in the popular media of the time. Hangping Xu will look at the socialist-era reception of the Russian novel How the Steel Was Tempered, focusing especially on the manner in which Chinese receptions of the male protagonist link his disability with moral exemplarity. Michel Hockx will look at the post-Mao creation of a moralistic value system for literature and art based on the concepts of truth, goodness, and beauty, tracing its influence all the way to cultural policy under the Xi Jinping regime. The panel will conclude with a paper by Xi Tian on recent changes in readership for Boys Love (BL) fiction in China and its contribution to resisting moralizing views on male homosexuality. The discussant will be Margaret Hillenbrand, whose wide-ranging research on Chinese literary and visual culture frequently touches upon themes of social and moral efficacy. "
Shiuon Chu,The Republic of China After 1949 and the (Re)making of Chinese Identities ,"Since its retreat to Taiwan in 1949, the Republic of China has staged itself as the legitimate international representative of China. In the second half of the twentieth century, combinations of state policies and non-official projects of cultural production forged Chinese identities on Taiwan, and through the ROCs status as Free China in the Cold War, shaped conceptions of Chinese-ness around the world. This role of the ROC, however, remains under-researched, as it does not fit into existing, territorialized frameworks for either Modern Chinese or Taiwanese history. Inspired by recent developments in Sinophone Studies, the four papers on this panel revisit the making of Chinese identities in relation to the post-1949 ROC state. Kungs paper focuses on Philippine-Chinese visits to Taiwan organized between 1958-1971, through which the Nationalist Government claimed the ROC as the motherland for overseas Chinese. Kings paper looks into how a world-renowned cookbook series written in post-war Taiwan helped redefine Chinese cuisine by including not only the four major regional cuisines of mainland China, but also a distinct category of Taiwanese cuisine. Yangs paper explores layers of Chinese identity in a popular basketball game held to celebrate Chiang Kai-sheks birthday from 1967 to 1968, in which competing teams were formed according to provinces/regions of the exiled ROC. Finally, Chus paper rewrites the complicated history of the provincial quota system in civil service examinations, which was based on the population of Chinese provinces in the early 1940s and implemented on Taiwan for more than four decades after 1949. "
Lisa Indraccolo,Beyond Ideology - Rethinking the Rhetoric of Power in Early Chinese Politico-,"In the light of the recent developments in Chinese intellectual history, a reassessment of early forms of argument construction is required to provide a more coherent narrative of the rhetoric of power and the power of rhetoric in Early China (Pines, Goldin & Kern 2015). Following in the footsteps of most recent cutting-edge studies (Allan 2015; Kern & Meyer 2017), the panel addresses the ways in which politico-philosophical discourse is constructed at both the argumentative and the conceptual levels in early Chinese received and excavated texts. The panel explores the rhetorical use of different kinds of texts embedded within larger narratives that are imbued with political meaning, and used to express ideologically informed views complying with underlying political agendas. The panelists address the topic from different angles, focusing on the argumentative architecture or the conceptual flesh of pertinent case studies. Paul Goldin provides a reinterpretation of a set of fundamental philosophical keywords employed in politico-philosophical discourse. Andrew Meyer discusses diplomacy as a powerful rhetorical tool through an analysis of the term zongheng and its semantic field. Dirk Meyer studies the argumentative use of Shangshu traditions to produce persuasive force and concomitantly construct cultural memory in Warring States philosophical texts. Lisa Indraccolo explores the dynamics of the ruler/minister relationship as a functional rhetorical trope in early Chinese politico-philosophical debates. By integrating insights gained from different disciplines -philosophy, rhetoric, material culture, intellectual history- the panel aims to provide a fresh perspective on the argumentative strategies at play in early Chinese political philosophy. "
