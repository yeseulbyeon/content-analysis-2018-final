0,Amy Catalinac,Japanese Politics and Foreign Policy: Harnessing Qualitative and Quantitative Textual ,"In recent years, an explosion of methods for text analysis has been transforming research in the humanities and social sciences.  While most of the new tools are quantitative, their effective application requires a deep understanding of the social and political context in which the documents being studied and words used exist. Applying text-as-data tools to documents written in languages other than English entails special challenges, such as how to extract  machine-readable text when a language uses thousands of characters.  This panel pulls together junior and mid-career scholars from Japan and the United States who are pioneering the application of these methods to Japanese documents to answer important questions in their fields of inquiry. Matsumoto and Okazaki use text analysis to demonstrate that the lowering of barriers to entry by commoners during the Meiji era did not result in a democratization of the hierarchy within elites. Gopelrud and Smith use millions of speeches in the Japanese Diet to show that Japan's 1994 electoral reform brought about the rise of  responsible party government. Katagiri uses 450,000 utterances on foreign policy in the same period to illustrate how worried Japanese politicians are about becoming entangled in U.S. wars. Catalinac, Bueno de Mesquita, and Smith use thousands of candidate manifestos to calibrate the degree to which candidates focus on different areas within their electoral districts. Panel discussion will focus on the substantive findings of the papers presented and also on the challenges involved in applying these tools to text in Japanese. "
1,Jennifer Prough,Making Place in Japanese Cities ,"Today more and more of the world's population is concentrated in urban areas, and this is particularly true throughout Asia. Cities are shaped as places by state and municipal institutions, migrants and longstanding residents, as well as transnational actors and international institutions. Indeed, cities are amalgamations of places, without one solid or consistent identity. Japan has an urbanization rate of more than 93 percent; and yet, as the national population is both aging and shrinking, cities are faced with significant demographic shifts. Japanese cities and citizens employ a variety of strategies to counteract these challenges at the municipal and local level. This panel will explore the various ways that cities are shaped, branded, experienced, and understood by the state, local institutions, and the people who reside or travel through them. Hasegawa examines tour guide narratives in Chjamachi, Yokohama analyzing the way that local businesses tell their stories for tourists.  Oyama discusses Nagareyama, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo that has been successful at rebranding itself to attract young families.  Prough examines the way that one off-the-beaten-path neighborhood in Kyoto remade itself as a site for local experiential tourism. While Puzo analyses the ways that foreign researchers in Osaka make place while out of place.  All of these papers thus address, ways that local actors and visitors construct a sense of place within Japanese cities in dialogue with broader national narratives and social issues. "
2,Christophe Thouny,Japanese Studies in the Age of the Planetary ,"The triple catastrophe of March 2011 combining earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster has durably affected Japan and our academic practices. Or has it? For it remains to account for the effect of this tragic event for Japan, Asia and the planet. This roundtable takes as a starting point the 2017 publication of Planetary Atmospheres and Urban Society After Fukushima, an anthology that attempts to make sense of the contemporaneity of Fukushima Japan in what we define as a planetary situation. Looking at cultural texts, political discourses, and urban practices, this volume claims for the necessity to understand the ongoing crisis of Fukushima Japan in terms of, as Thomas Looser argues,  a common assemblage of processes in which we are all implicated. Acknowledging this new situation is the necessary starting point for rethinking the role of the humanities and relocate Japanese studies within emerging discourses about the anthropocene, post-humanism and urban dwelling. Following the approach pioneered in this volume, we argue for the need to combine effectively the analysis of cultural texts with both theoretical reflection and a proper understanding of everyday practices in urban places. Following a short introduction on the concept of planetary thinking in relation to recent debates in the humanities, Japanese studies and ecocriticism, the roundtable then proceeds in two parts each articulated around one theme and a disciplinary approach. Drawing on their extended knowledge of conditions of urban life in Tokyo and the Fukushima prefecture after 3.11, Ramona Bajema and Ccile Brice discuss the import of the concept of the planetary to understand the everyday reality of local populations and their affective investments in local dwelling places in relation to population movements and housing policies. In a second part, Ueno Toshiya and Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto then propose a reframing of the debates about Fukushima Japan in terms of a planetary thinking. Drawing in particular on recent environmental thought inspired by Flix Guattari's 1989 Three Ecologies, they ask how our disciplinary practices can be productively renewed to answer our planetary situation in Fukushima Japan and other times and places. "
3,Garrett L. Washington,"Rethinking Education and Women's Empowerment in Imperial, Occupied, and ","Women in modern Japan have faced entrenched biases and considerable obstacles. And yet, as significant research on Tsuda Umeko has demonstrated, some found pathways to public, professional lives through education. Building from those insights, this panel examines how elite women in imperial and postwar Japan used education to empower themselves and influence society. Mamiko Suzuki investigates Meiji court lady and Jissen Women's University founder Utako Shimoda (1854-1936). She developed a modern, gendered curriculum that combined practical subjects such as Domestic Science with courses highlighting female role models from ancient Japanese history and myth. Garrett Washington examines Yasui Tetsu (1870-1945), who attended Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School and the University of Cambridge, founded Tokyo Women's Christian University, and became Japan's first woman university president when she assumed the presidency at TWCU in 1925. Marlene Mayo studies Tomiyama Toki (b. 1885), principal of the Friends' Girls School in Tokyo from 1926 and 1949, who developed transnational networks, studied abroad in the US, and then led her alma mater through World War II and the early Allied Occupation. Alisa Freedman analyzes pioneering efforts of Japanese women who studied abroad in the U.S between 1949 and 1966 and then played a significant role in establishing the field of Japanese Studiesâ€”a role underemphasized in the conventional  founding fathers narrative. Together, these papers present agentic Japanese women, from the Meiji period to the postwar era, who seized educational opportunities at home and abroad and later founded universities, advanced academic fields, and elevated women's status in Japan. "
4,Miriam Kingsberg Kadia,Representing Imperial Japan and its Aftermath ,"Coming Soon "
5,James C. Dobbins,Publishing in Scholarly Journals on Japan ,"This workshop is a roundtable discussion on publishing in scholarly journals, particularly ones focused on Japan. The panelists consist of the editors of five important journals based variously in North America, the U.K., and Japan: Pacific Affairs, Journal of Japanese Studies, Japan Forum, Monumenta Nipponica, and Social Science Japan Journal. The goal is to outline and elucidate the pathway to publishing in these journals in the hope of demystifying the process for scholars, especially younger ones in the early stages of their career. In exploring different aspects of this process, the workshop will provide plenty of time for the audience to ask questions. The session will consist of four segments addressing the following sample questions: 1. Introduction to the Five Journals What is the mission or focus of each journal, and what type of submissions does each consider? Is it all right to contact an editor for advice before submitting an article? How long does the submission and publication process take? What percentage of submissions actually reach publication?  2. Publishing Academic Articles What are the stages of review for submissions? How does the blind refereeing process work? What does a revise-and-resubmit response mean? What are the complications in trying to publish dissertation chapters both as individual articles and as chapters in a book?  3. Publishing Book Reviews How are books selected for review? How are book reviewers selected? Why are some books not reviewed? What happens when a reviewer finds a book seriously problematic or unworthy of review?  4. Special Concerns in Publishing What are the pros and cons of the blind referring process? How important is the  impact factor of a journal? How can journals be more transparent in their operations?  As much as possible, this workshop seeks to create an open forum on all aspects of scholarly publishing for potential contributors. "
6,Daria Melnikova,"Artists Acting up in the Season of Politics: Literature, Folklore, Performance, ","This interdisciplinary panel examines the role of the artist and artistic practices in the politically charged milieu of Japan in the 1960s to 1970s. We are driven by large and enduring questions: What is art and what is non-art? What are different ways to be political, and what, if anything, is nonpolitical? How do different aspects of the medium affect the artistic or political message? How do writers, performers, architects, and theorists grapple with these issues in an era of highly politicized art? In order to answer these questions, this panel brings together scholars at different stages in their careers from four different disciplines to address a wide range of media. Andrew Rankin opens the panel with a theoretical investigation of Mishima Yukio's notion of  aesthetic terrorism, which stresses a fundamentally transgressive and oppositional view of art. Lisa Hsieh's paper explores the practices of Anti-Art and Non-Art by focusing on multimedia works, especially the ephemera associated with the architectural New Wave  nongroup ArchiteXt. This is followed by Hideyo Konagaya's analysis of the politicized dichotomy of artistic versus folkloristic/non-artistic dance, in understanding Okinawan/Ryukyuan performance as part of Japanese cultural property. And finally, Daria Melnikova's discussion of Hi Red Center examines the use of bodies and images in the group's artistic practices, interpreting these in relation to the era's image politics. Our two discussants address questions of art and politics from the perspectives of film/media studies (Laura Lee) and political science (Mary Alice Haddad) respectively. "
7,Paul Berry,Rethinking the Scope and Significance of  Sensoga (War Painting) During the 15-,"The topic of  sensoga (war paintings), a loosely defined genre of art referring to Japan's involvement with the 15-Year War (1931-1945), has been surrounded with debate since the US's seizure of a limited group of these works during the turmoil of the Allied Occupation of Japan.  Today, the number of sensoga researchers in America, Japan and elsewhere, with a variety of contested views, has grown to such a degree that it is increasingly difficult to establish a coherent arena for discussion among them.  Despite the multitude of approaches, however, there has emerged a set of common presumptions that has shaped not only the results of each research effort but the very nature of what is being investigated. This multi-national panel will seek to challenge the established parameters of the investigation of sensoga through presenting diverse theses that identify and explore some major overlooked territories of scholarship.  Individual papers will address issues that provide new perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding of sensoga: Paul Berry presents a new organizational structure of the notion based on exhibitions and international comparisons; Reita Hirase's talk discusses the impact of the Army on the public through its sponsorship of traveling exhibitions; Yasuko Tsuchikane examines the enigmatic status of religious art produced during the war for a Buddhist institution; and Megumi Kitahra analyzes the alteration and production of war paintings during the Occupation in the  Reports of General MacArthur. "
8,Christopher Lowy,Embodied Texts: Rescripting Modern Japanese Literature and Media History ,"Much has been said about the particular characteristics of the Japanese writing system such as its employment of three distinct scripts (kanji, hiragana, and katakana) and its possibility for intertextual glossing. These particularities, however, are often described in essentialized and/or self-exoticizing terms which inhibit productive discussion of said script and its relationship to literature and culture. With that in mind, this panel will consider the codependent nature of script and text from various modes of production in terms that actively reject notions of determinative uniqueness while recognizing its actual effects on the larger cultural sphere. Seth Jacobowitz will read Nishi Amane's calls for a phonetic system of Romanized Japanese script against his fascination with Egyptian, Phoenician, and Aztec scripts. Miyako Inoue will discuss how the development of the kana-typewriter in the late nineteenth century lead to the re-sexualization of writing as a masculine enterprise and to the reunion of the man's hand with language. Finally, Chris Lowy will re-read Tanizaki Jun'ichiro's The Key (1955) â€“ a text written in two distinct written styles â€“ in terms that move discussions of the narratives structure away from a male/female binary to a center/periphery binary. Our two discussants will help us think through these questions that seem to straddle the linguistic and literary at every corner: Zev Handel, a historical linguist who specializes in the development of East Asian writing systems, and Tsuboi Hideto, a scholar of Japanese literature who was written extensively on the aesthetic role of script in modern literature. "
9,Andrew Bernstein,Omenology and Ritual Responses to Disaster Among Heian-period Elites ,"Omens and rituals concerning both personal and collective disasters preoccupied the elites of Heian Japan.  By examining the interpretive apparatus surrounding a particular type of disaster and/or portent, each paper in this panel adds to our understanding of how the explanation and manipulation of such inauspicious phenomena determined the fortunesâ€”or rather, misfortunesâ€”of those elites.  Andrew Bernstein focuses on the divinations and other rituals surrounding Mt. Fuji's eruptionsâ€”frequently viewed as omens of epidemicâ€”to better comprehend the culture of fear that shaped the dynamics of the Japanese court.  Alessandro Poletto looks at the tenth-century development of a new astrological discourse about earthquakes to shed light on the roles played by the court-appointed yin-yang specialists (onmyji) who promoted it.  Kristina Buhrman also turns our attention skyward, in her case by showing how single-tailed comets, or  broom stars, were interpreted as signs of impendingâ€”and for those invested in the status quo, catastrophicâ€”regime change.  Taken together, these papers not only illuminate the ritual politics of Heian Japan but also contribute more broadly to our understanding of how disasters are both experienced and interpreted. "
10,Kazue Takamura,Immigration Detention and Human Rights of Non-Status Migrants in Japan ,"The primary goal of the panel is to engage with the emerging human rights concerns surrounding the treatment of asylum-seekers and non-status migrants in Japan. Despite the global plea for the protection of refugees and forced migrants, Japan maintains highly restrictive and discriminatory policies regarding the admission of asylum-seekers and migrants, especially from low-income Asian countries. One of the key concerns is the precarious condition of migrants in immigration detention facilities. Migrant advocacy groups have documented unexplained deaths in detention facilities, prolonged detention, and violent and arbitrary deportation of migrants. Although Japan is a signatory to the Refugee Convention and other key international human rights treaties, its failure to address these human rights problems indicates a wanton disregard of international human rights law. In the current body of immigration literature, the problems of Japan's immigration detention and the condition of non-status migrants are largely underexamined. Our three panelists â€“ an anthropologist and two political scientists - will unpack such hidden human rights dilemmas in Japan. The first presenter, Kazue Takamura from McGill University, will interrogate Japan's immigration detention practice through the voices of migrant advocacy groups in Japan. The second presenter, Anderson Villa from Ateneo de Davao University, will examine Japan's immigration detention and deportation policies through the actual experiences of Filipino migrant workers and their family members. The third presenter, Petrice Flowers from the University of Hawaii, Manoa, will discuss Japan's broader human rights norms especially by questioning the norm of refugee protection. "
11,Grace E. Ting,Hierarchies and Rainbows in Japan and Beyond: Problematizing Western Rubrics of ,"Our panel presents analyses of Japanese premodern erotica, contemporary fiction, and transnational fandoms to debate the politics of interpreting representations of homoeroticism and/or homosociality within existing frameworks such as modern sexology, Anglo-American queer studies, and LGBTQ activism. We are particularly aware of problems arising from imperialist tendencies to impose  Western rubricsâ€”drawn from studies of the U.S. and Europeâ€”on non-Western contexts, as well as an overemphasis on the modern. Our panel moves across time between hierarchies in the 14th century, urgent politics of thriving transnational fandoms, and historical contexts of modern Japan. Sachi Schmidt-Hori examines the lord-vassal relationship between an elite youth and his wet nurse's son in the 14th-century text Chigo no sshi (A book of acolytes), pointing to how power relations subvert assumed hierarchies in male-male intercourse. Following, Casey Lee analyzes Orientalizing aspects of  Western queer theorizing about seme-uke in Japanese and Chinese BL (Boys Love) communities, while theorizing intimacies found within largely female fandoms. Grace Ting discusses the 2014 novel Rainbow Garden's depictions of lesbian happiness within an LGBT framework against the context of a longer transmedia history of female love and friendship in Japan. As our discussant, Samuel Perry offers his perspective as scholar and translator of queer work from Japan and Korea. Through the meeting of our projects across divisions such as homoerotic/homosocial, female/male, premodern/modern, and text/fan, we show our divergent methods of engaging with power relations, definitions of  queer/ness, and LGBTQ activism in a conversation exploring and challenging mainstream assumptions concerning gender and sexuality. "
12,Tomoyuki Sasaki,"The Constitution in Dispute: Japan Debates Peace, Sovereignty, and Democracy ","Japan's so-called  peace Constitution has a history of controversy. Since its birth during US occupation, it has provoked vigorous discussions over peace, sovereignty, and democracy. Prime Minister Abe from the conservative Liberal Democratic Party has affirmed his eagerness to amend the Constitution by 2020 to break with the  postwar regime constructed by occupation forces. This panel brings together specialists from political science, history, and international relations, to join this political debate, examining court cases, popular culture, and citizens' movements. First, Shunichi Takekawa traces the evolution of two divergent views on constitutional revision proposed by Japan's major conservative newspapers: the Yomiuri and Sankei. He examines their discussions of the military, the emperor, and popular sovereignty, thereby setting the broader context for the subsequent papers. Tomoyuki Sasaki analyzes theoretical problems raised by conservative calls for constitutional revision. Focusing on court cases over constitutional rights, he questions the need to amend a document that has been democratically maintained for seventy years. Tom Le elaborates on Japan's anxiety over remilitarization under the Constitution through his nuanced analysis of a popular cinematic text, Shin Godzilla (2016), challenging more conventional readings of this text. Gabriele Vogt investigates the citizens' movement in Okinawa and the democratic notion of global citizenship, which activists have pursued to stage their protests within and beyond the area of the Constitution's application. Finally, Tsuneo Akaha uses his expertise in international relations to offer insight into the topics raised by the presenters and locates their significance within the international context. "
13,Marianne Tarcov,"Bodies in Pain, Pleasure, and Flux: Transgressive Femininity in Japanese Media and ","Across a diverse set of texts from Japanese media and literature, ranging from professional wrestling to avant-garde writing to video games, this panel explores the fluid relationship between femininity and the body, where one is neither defined nor determined by the other.  Ben-Youssef examines Takahara Hidekazu's Gamushara (Live Recklessly, 2015) cycle of women's professional wrestling documentaries, in which a villain wrestler's retirement match becomes a meditation on the loss of a transgressive feminine identity centered around violence. Hemmann investigates the gaps between Japanese and Anglophone fan reception of the video game character Linkle. What do these gaps reveal about the industries that produce popular media, and about feminist discussion in fandom communities? Osborne analyzes the female body-in-pain in the 1960s work of writer Kanai Mieko, who invokes a bodily-engaged readership as active participants in the act of writing, rather than as passive recipients. Tarcov argues that, in 1910s Japanese Symbolist poetry and perfume advertising, there emerges a distinctive mode of imagining femininity, one where  true womanhood is defined, not by a bodily female essence, but by fluidity, by the ability to transform using cosmetics as a tool of metamorphosis. Interrogating borders not only between genders, but also media, genres, and nations, the texts discussed here investigate transgressive femininity in Japanese media and literature, from the onset of mass media in the 1910s, to the radicalism of the 1960s, and into the present day. "
14,Eugenia Bogdanova-Kummer,Networks of Modern Japanese Art: Personal Dimensions ,"Critically reconsidering the historiography of modern Japanese art, this panel spotlights the professional network of Japanese art historian, abstract painter, theoretician, and innovative curator Hasegawa Sabur (1906-1957). Key promoter of abstraction in Japan, Hasegawa contributed to developing several areas of modern art, including surrealist photography, abstract painting and sculpture, and avant-garde calligraphy. Active in Japan, France, and later the United States, Hasegawa initiated artistic dialogue between artists and theoreticians previously unrelated to one another, and formed unique theories that generated new constellations of art works, artists, and ideas. Inspired by the upcoming exhibition on Hasegawa's collaboration with an American sculptor Isamu Noguchi (1904-1988) to be on view in New York, San Francisco and Yokohama in 2019, this panel brings together scholars from the United States and Japan for a focused discussion about Hasegawa's place in modern Japanese art. To reexamine Hasegawa's often overlooked accomplishments, panelists address Hasegawa's interactions with other artists and theoreticians of his time. This approach represents the postwar art system as a network of individual agents, who form art historical thinking in an interactive exchange between co-thinkers, followers, competitors, and antagonists. Each paper in this panel examines Hasegawa's interaction with a particular artist, including Hasegawa's contacts with the leader of the Gutai group Yoshihara Jir (1905-1972), avant-garde calligrapher Inoue YÅ«ichi (1916-1985), and German painter and graphic designer Hans Richter (1888-1976). The panel also features a contribution by a visual artist and robotics designer Okazaki Kenjir, who introduces his original theory of abstraction informed by Hasegawa's ideas. "
15,Namiko Kunimoto,"Spectacle and Crises at the Tokyo Olympic Games: 1940, 1964, and 2020 ","The spectacle of the Olympic Games provides an opportunity to present a vision of unityâ€”of a city, of a nation, or of the international community.  But competing visions of what such a unified entity should look like often lead to crises. In the case of the three Olympic Games planned for Tokyo, one of the world's largest cities, attempts to regulate internal and external relationships reveal Japan's careful negotiation of urban transformation, domestic politics, and international relations through the symbols and rhetoric of this global event. This interdisciplinary panel explores the use of spectacle to create social unity in the realms of politics, aesthetics, and the environment in the contexts of the  phantom Olympics of 1940, the successful 1964 Games, and the forthcoming 2020 Olympiad. How do the discursive tensions between municipal politics and state politics, and between nationalism and internationalism, generate consequences for the environment, for literature, and for visual art? How have the Tokyo Games mobilized citizens to enact dissent in the arts, on the streets, and through official channels? How have these responses informed one another? Why are the Olympics such a fruitful venue for these contestations? This panel brings together art historical, historical, and literary methodologies to examine the diachronic narratives of unity constructed around the spectacle of the Tokyo Olympic Games and the crises these narratives provoked. "
16,Daqing Yang,Cosmopolitan Scientists of Empire: Japanese Experts in Trans-war and Trans-,"Under the influence of John Dower, Chalmers Johnson and Andrew Gordon, historians have come to regard continuities across the Second World War to be a key in understanding 20th-century Japanese institutions and practices. This is also the case with many Japanese scientists including Nobel prize laureates. They forged close ties with global scientific communities at the start of the 20th century, which were cut off by the war in the late 1930s and early 1940s, only to be resumed after Japan's defeat in 1945. As recent studies begin to show, no less important for understanding modern Japan and the world of science were those Japanese scientists who played a direct or indirect role in Japan's colonial enterprises. Many of these men came from elite families, had studied or traveled to the West, and were considered as  cosmopolitan gentlemen of science. After the wartime hiatus they managed to reconnect with the international community, often through American colleagues and America-led institutions. As geneticists, geologists and zoologists, their personal trajectories epitomized another key feature of Japan's own 20th-century historyâ€”from one of the leading colonial empires to a subordinate to the U.S. but certainly not a passive bystander in world affairs. More significantly, the scientific knowledge produced for and in imperial Japan went on to gain wider recognition and even played a part in shaping the postwar world. In this sense, modern Japan's scientists and their expertise became as trans-imperial as they were trans-war. "
17,Amy Stanley,"Reconsidering Recreating Japanese Women: On the Past, Present, and Future of ","Thirty years ago, a group of scholars, most of them women at public universities in the Midwest and the West, gathered at a conference in Tucson, Arizona and presented their research in what was then the emerging field of Japanese women's history. The result was the pioneering collection Recreating Japanese Women, 1600-1945 (ed. Gail Lee Bernstein, University of California Press, 1991).  In this volume, scholars of social, demographic, and cultural history, art history, and anthropology considered the diverse historical experiences of women and, in the words of the editor, investigated the  creation of female gender in Japan. Published when gender was a relatively new category of historical analysis, and most  standard histories of Japan ignored women, it became the defining work in the field. Decades later, its essays are still frequently cited, and they are mainstays on undergraduate and graduate syllabi. In this roundtable, a multigenerational group of historians of Japan, including two of the original contributors to Recreating Japanese Women, will look back at the volume, reflect on what has (and has not) changed in the last three decades of scholarship in women's and gender history, and consider some possibilities for future directions in the field. Anne Walthall will look back at the original project and the challenges participants faced in convincing Japanese studies to take women seriously. Sally Hastings will consider the difficulties scholars still encounter in writing women's history and interrogate the unstated assumptions that continue to shape our work. Marnie Anderson will discuss the intellectual history of the field in both the United States and in Japan across the twentieth century, with special attention to the turn to gender history that occurred around the time the volume was published. Andrew Gordon will discuss the achievements of the field and point to some future possibilities and challenges, including the ongoing need for transnational and comparative work that addresses Japanese experience. Finally, Yurika Wakamatsu will offer a new perspective from the field of Japanese visual culture, which raises questions about the importance and limitations of the categories of  women and  women's history. "
18,Gergana E. Ivanova,Selling the Classics: Heian Literature in Manga ,"This panel will present four perspectives on manga (graphic novel) adaptations of Heian (794-1185) literary works and their roles in the popularization of classical literature in twenty-first century Japan. How has the manga medium re-invented texts from the distant past? What strategies does it employ to market these works and to what ends? How do graphic novels construct Japan's national tradition and character in reaction to trends such as globalization and multiculturalism? What insights do these adaptations provide about manga's function as a powerful tool for expanding cultural literacy? The panelists will approach these questions considering the multiple functions that manga appropriations of Heian-period texts perform in Japan today, while drawing parallels to some of their medieval and early modern illustrated renditions. Mika Saito will examine nationalistic overtones in a recent adaptation of Taketori monogatari (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, early 10th c.), while Joshua S. Mostow will consider the role of visual intertextuality in transposing Ise monogatari ( The Ise Stories, 10th c.) into a manga form. Gergana Ivanova will focus on new perceptions of what Makura no sshi (The Pillow Book, early 11th c.) is as presented in graphic novels, and Pana Barova Ã–zcan will take up images of the reading woman and their implications in Sarashina nikki (The Sarashina Diary, ca. 1058) manga. "
19,Robert Tuck,Writing Men and Women in Imperial Japan:  Performing and Contesting Gender in ,"This panel combines close analysis of individual literary works with study of the social and material conditions in which they arise, to ask how, where, and by whom gendered subjectivity could be performed and contested in Imperial Japan. Ranging from early Meiji to wartime, the papers share a common interest in subversions or contradictions of hegemonic gender norms: women writing kanshi (Sinitic poetry), boys becoming girls' slaves, men refusing to dress as men, and feminist romantic novelists working for the militarist state. The papers analyze how writers challenged the gendered dynamics of the literary genres of kanshi and romance novels, and of the behavioral realms of childhood games and dress-codes, to articulate their voices as individuals and to offer broader criticisms about prevalent social ideologies. Tuck's paper highlights early Meiji female kanshi poets' use of the quasi-erotic poetic topos of the boudoir, the feminine emotional resonance of this trope enabling the circumvention of male concerns over whether women should write kanshi at all. Suzuki explores Tanizaki Jun'ichirÅ™s 1911 story  Boy and its presentation of children's secret games as a venue in which to imagine terrifying subversions of gender dynamics. Yasuda considers how Dazai Osamu's works depict the social coding of  fashion under the wartime state, as Dazai's characters alternately resist and conform to clothing-related gender norms. Lastly, Frederick traces the development and reception of Yoshiya Nobuko's  emotional style, drawing attention to the performative aspects of this female-gendered prose style across diverse contexts ranging from feminist erotic prose to wartime reportage. "
20,Seok Won Lee,"Empire, the World and the International: Rethinking Postwar Japanese Intellectual ","A massive body of literature has revealed how American value systems â€“ democracy and the market economy â€“ dominated postwar Japanese politics, culture and society. On the other hand, recent studies show another facet of postwar Japan, that is, how a new  Japanese subjectivity was sought in the early postwar period through the movements of radical Marxism, literary circles, local towns. To understand the conundrum of the preponderance of American values and the search for a Japanese subjectivity, one needs to examine how Japanese subjects were exposed to various ideas that constituted the postwar concept of the world. More importantly, revealing the intellectual trajectories of early postwar Japan would not be possible without tracing the continuity and discontinuity of Japan's wartime discourses. Three presentations in this panel show these intertwined aspects of the early formation of postwar Japan from the perspective of intellectual history. In doing so, this panel aims to answer a set of questions, focusing on but not limited to (1) how the Kyoto School philosophers â€“ virtually advocates of wartime Japanese empire â€“ remapped the spatial and historical concept of the world in the early Cold War, and (2) how the concept of democracy and a public encounter with or top-down engineering of democracy through the media was discussed by postwar Japanese intellectuals. Finally, this panel explores the question of the early postwar discussion of Asia and the international order by a group of postwar Japanese social scientists, most of whom were supporters of Japan's wartime empire. "
21,Miriam Chusid,Matrix and Materiality: Re-conceptualizing Icons and Embodied Objects in Japanese ,"This panel seeks to re-conceptualize the notion of icons and embodied objects in Japanese Buddhist visual and material culture, and to ask how art and rituals promulgated larger belief systems. It has long been recognized that Buddhism is a religion whose tenets are constantly being absorbed, reinterpreted, and disseminated through images. Icons hold a particularly important place in Buddhist practice and thought: as the embodiment of a deity's presence, they have the power to impart benefits on a receiver when ritually activated. While scholarship has greatly elucidated the function of these objects, less well studied is the visual matrix from which these images were given form, and ultimately, meaning. This panel aims to go beyond an inquiry of the role that Buddhist icons played in a ritual arena to ask how architectural setting, spatial context, artistic tradition, or monastic lineage exerted influence on the ways in which these images were presented to and perceived by their viewers. Can objects besides icons embody a presence? If so, how was this presence visually manifested and communicated? Through a series of case studies, this panel addresses: how Buddhist palimpsests embodied the deceased's memory and recovered his or her existence; how the natural environment contributed to the sacred aura of the Eleven-headed AvalokiteÅ›vara at Hasedera; how the transformation of King Enma into an icon fundamentally altered the nature of the deity; and how medieval sculptural representations of Shtoku Taishi's manifestation of the Buddha's eyeball at age two powerfully invert the modern scholastic gaze. "
22,Hiroaki Kawamura,Entanglements and Meshworks in Japan: Japan Through the Lens of Posthumanism ,"Since the 1960's, various social theories have influenced our understanding of Japanese society. Among others, post-modernism (e.g., Miyoshi and Harootunian 1989; Sugimoto 2014; Denoon et al. 2001) helped shed light on such issues as national identity, gender politics, internal diversity, and encouraged researchers to pay more attention to processes of Japan-making. However, this effort still fails to examine Japan holistically since those frameworks are all anthropocentric by nature. Analysis is always from human viewpoints based on the assumption that humans are different and detached from anything else. In reality, humans are constantly engaged in dynamic interaction with others (e.g., robots [O'Mathuna 2015], microbiome [Roden 2015], ghosts [Haynes 2017], non-human animals [Haraway 2003], cyborgs [Haraway 1984, Lavender III 2017]). Drawing scholars from anthropology, literature, and philosophy, this interdisciplinary panel will examine contemporary Japanese society by recognizing it as a  zone of entanglement (Ingold 2008) for humans and non-humans.  Kawamura will look at how humans and non-human animals develop perception together through practices of touching. Cook will examine entanglements between the microbiome and food allergies in Japan, focusing specifically on human efforts to alter their microbial relationships. Ma's paper contends that the Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell and its Hollywood remake feign an off-white or yellow-ish soul (the  ghost named Major Motoko) secreted within a posthuman cyborg body that is suspiciously white. Saha will examine the trend that is now prevalent in Japan to proceed towards the development of humanoid robots designed and marketed specifically to enhance and augment human society. "
23,Susan Schmidt,"Earning Your Stripes as an Academic: Advice on Publishing, Presenting, ","An academic career rests on a foundation of teaching and scholarship. Being a dedicated and inspiring teacher and a hard-working and ambitious scholar is the all-important first step in advancing in the academy. However, building a career requires other, more practical, skills as well. This panel focuses on professional development resources and skills for younger faculty and graduate students in the Asian language and literature field, though the information it offers will be relevant to those in any field. A group of professionals and senior scholars with decades of experience in mentoring younger colleagues will discuss: getting published, in both journal and book formats; interviewing for positions and other professional opportunities; developing winning presentations; collaborating with others in your field; and identifying and applying for scholarships, grants, and fellowships. Editors on the panel represent the journals Japanese Language and Literature (published by AATJ) and Foreign Language Annals (published by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages), and the academic publisher Columbia University Press. In addition to senior faculty and publishing professionals in the Japanese and Asian language and literature fields, the panel will include a representative from the American Association of Teachers of German, to describe how that field supports its members who teach German language and literature. The speakers will share their own experiences and introduce professional development resources both in print and online. Members of the audience will be invited to share their experiences in a general conversation to close the session. "
24,Kyle K. Ikeda,Reflecting on Ryukyuan and Okinawan Literary Studies ,"This panel explores challenges, insights, and suggestions for researching, translating, and teaching Ryukyuan and Okinawan Literature. The recent publications in English of two canonical kumi odori plays, the anthology of modern Okinawan literature Islands of Protest, and the first English translation of a novel by an Okinawan writer, In the Woods of Memory (by Medoruma Shun), taken together mark a significant moment for Ryukyuan, Okinawan and Japanese literary studies. Now scholars and students of Japan, Okinawa, and the Ryukyus have access in English to many of the foremost pieces of Ryukyuan and Okinawan literature which cover a variety of important topics and themes. The panel discussants will share their experience regarding the research, translation, and/or teaching of Ryukyuan and/or Okinawan literature for the purpose of sharing insights, collaboratively thinking through common challenges, and reflecting on the significance of the increased access to Ryukyuan and Okinawan literary texts in English. Nobuko Ochner will share some of the challenges and insights from translating classical Ryukyuan kumi odori, Shushin Kani'iri and Manzai Tichiuchi, with reference to kumi odori in Hawaii. James Edwards will talk about the technical challenge of preserving the musicality in his translation of the prewar musical drama Iejima Hand-gwa, which integrates early modern Ryukyuan poetic forms within a modern through-composed musical structure. After discussing the process of compiling Islands of Protest: Japanese Literature from Okinawa, from inception to completion, Davinder Bhowmik will reflect on the anthology's place in her recent courses on Okinawan literature and film. Takuma Sminkey will present insights regarding the interpretation and translating of Sakiyama Tami's ""Island Confinement"" and Medoruma Shun's In the Woods of Memory. He will also discuss his experience teaching Okinawan literature at Okinawa International University. Following her research on Sakiyama Tami's writing that demands critical engagement with the category of Okinawan literature, Vicky Young will discuss the possibilities, pitfalls, and significance of teaching Okinawan fiction, whose themes draw heavily on a US military presence, within a Japanese literature classroom in the UK. In addition to Ryukyu and Okinawa specialists, we hope to engage non-specialists interested in incorporating Ryukyuan/Okinawan texts into their courses. "
25,Aya Louisa McDonald,"Remembering Executive Order #9066: Post-war, Post-internment Art by Japanese ","Seventy-five years ago in the heart of the nation's capital, in the aftermath of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor and the US entry into WWII, President Roosevelt signed the infamous Executive Order #9066, which bypassed the rule of law and forcibly relocated thousands of Japanese residents of the west coast, many of them US citizens, to heavily guarded internment camps, known euphemistically as War Relocation Centers.  Far from belonging to the  past, the controversial issue of the Japanese wartime Internment is alive and relevant today, not just in the United States, but globally; the politics of racial and cultural exclusionism and the separation of peoples into hierarchies of value threatens democracy and justice everywhere. In this moment, three-quarters of a century after the fact, this panel focuses on the complex interrelation between the historical facts and the personal and collective memory of Japanese wartime incarceration, racism and dissidence, injustice and resistance, imagination and trauma, and modes of remembering in contemporary visual and performing art with the intention of moving the scholarly discussion beyond wartime into the present post-war, post-internment era. Three of the papers in this panel look deeply and critically at how contemporary Japanese and Japanese-American artists working in a variety of creative media, from painting, printmaking and photography, to theater, have mediated and transformed their experience into art, with what intent, and to what effect. The fourth paper takes up the issues in the context of exhibitions and curatorial power. "
26,Carl Gabrielson,Signs of Empire: Emerging Faces of Japanese Imperialism ,"Neo-imperial formations in Japan, as elsewhere, no longer require a settler colonial project to impose hegemonic structures abroad. Aside from Hokkaido and Okinawa, Japan was stripped of its colonial territories after its 1945 defeat. Yet, recent attempts by both state and corporate actors to expand Japan's regional influence are haunted by the ghosts of Japanese imperialism. Foreign aid policies that buoyed Japan's international reputation throughout the post-war era occupy a more ambivalent position today. Under the Abe administration's neoliberal branding, the state has shifted its aid policy away from humanitarianism toward boosting corporate profits and military-industrial partnerships. Moreover, purportedly harmless humanitarian projects may nevertheless serve militarist ideological ends domestically or impose imperial constraints on foreign beneficiaries abroad. In response, this panel will seek to reframe the question of how imperial formations occupy range of domains, from popular culture to peace-keeping operations. Smith considers how activists of the far right have cultivated and deployed an â€˜imperial subjectivity' as a political sensibility and philosophy of action. Gabrielson examines the recent inclusion of imperialist racial ideology in globally-oriented Japanese children's media in order to illustrate the increasingly sophisticated ways that nationalist and militarist agendas are inflecting Japan's cultural promotion policies. Lewallen argues that Japan has sought to prop up its beleaguered post-Fukushima nuclear sector by peddling a  Nuclear Renaissance packaged as foreign aid to developing nations. Sato and Weinek examine how efforts to increase the visibility of women in Japan's Self-Defense Forces conceal the emergence of new imperialist formations. "
27,Margherita Long,Fukushima: Sustaining Struggle ,"This round-table brings together three US-based academics who study Fukushima activism and two public intellectuals from Japan: community leader Mut Ruiko and filmmaker Kamanaka Hitomi. We will begin with how each of the three academics â€“ historian Hirano and literature scholars Field and Long -- sees Mut and Kamanaka addressing the social divisions and individual injuries resulting from the nuclear disaster, exacerbated by national  recovery (fukk) policies. Mut will describe the process by which citizens came together as Complainants for Criminal Prosecution of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster and persisted in the face of repeated prosecutorial refusal to hold anyone accountable for the disaster. Their efforts twice yielded a decision by citizen inquest committees that three former TEPCO executives were  appropriate for indictment. Now, an extraordinary criminal trial has begun at Tokyo District Court. We will ask Mut about the significance of pursuing criminal responsibility for the nuclear disaster, in relation to the thirty civil cases involving some 10,000 plaintiffs unfolding throughout the country. We will take up MutÅ™s published interview with Hirano and her other writings and published speeches that emphasize the importance of fun, laughter, care, and gender in the everyday poetics of struggle. Kamanaka will outline how local screening-and-discussions (jishu jei) of her nuclear documentaries have built communities of alternate-media inspired activism, and how she has used online forums to create public spheres to contest the government's  safety myth with facts, science, and history. In response to Field's observation that workers and residents of communities hosting nuclear power plants are often forced to choose between biological life/safety (seimei) and economic livelihood (seikatsu), Kamanaka argues the possibility of engaging nuclear victimization in a way that demands but also generates energy in those communities. We will discuss this in the context of her films, four of which she has agreed to supply for the 2018 AAS Film Expo: Hibakusha at the End of the World (2003) Surviving Internal Radiation (2012) Little Voices of Fukushima (2014) Kama Repo (selections, monthly field-videos for e-subscribers, 2011-2017) "
28,Robert Hellyer,"The Meiji Restoration at 150:  Researching, Commemorating, and Teaching ","2018 marks the 150-year anniversary of the Meiji Restoration, a seminal moment in Japanese and arguably Asian modern history.  This roundtable offers an innovative panel format to examine the Restoration by combining discussion of its historical significance, its place in scholarly and popular discourse today, as well as approaches for exploring it in the classroom. Composed of historians, a legal scholar, and a political scientist, the panel will consider recent trends in scholarship along with the Restoration's 150-year commemoration inside and outside Japan.  Moreover, the panelists will discuss new approaches to teaching the Restoration, with emphasis on primary sources used and how the event can be presented within Asian and world history. The participants have researched the Restoration through respective military/economic, social, legal, political, and diplomatic lenses and three members bring viewpoints via researching and teaching the event at Japanese institutions.  Additionally, three discussants and the chair will offer perspectives on current interpretations and research trends gained by organizing international symposia focused on the Restoration and its 150-year anniversary:  Hellyer (the civil wars surrounding the Restoration), Botsman (social change and spatial transformation during and after the Restoration), Takii (convener of a regular international workshop series on the Restoration and Meiji periods) and Dickinson (multi-year project exploring local and international connections between Japan and Philadelphia before and after the Restoration). Tinello brings perspectives on Okinawa's incorporation into the Meiji state following the Restoration and Leheny will review the Meiji Restoration and its 150-year commemorations in current Japanese political movements and discourse. To begin the session, each discussant will have up to 10 minutes to explain the Restoration through his research, detail perspectives on commemorations, and explain approaches to teaching the event. For approximately 20 minutes, the chair will then lead a larger discussion among the panelists, focusing on the following: what challenges does the Meiji Restoration pose for crafting narratives of modern Japanese history as well as why the Meiji Restoration is relevant to Japan and the world today?  The chair will assure that the remaining time will be reserved for questions, comments, and discussion from the audience. "
29,Matthew Shores,"Chic Freaks, Pro Amateurs, Double-Layered Antics, and Belly Buttons: The ","One of the hallmarks of the Edo period (1600-1868) is the flourishing of various new artistic and literary art forms, particularly those playful and humorous. This panel looks at comical arts and literature of the second half of the period, when the ruling class struggled to maintain power in the face of inevitable change. Comical arts flourished, fueling discontent and providing an outlet for subversion and/or escape. As we will show, comic storytelling traditionsâ€”and subsequent related publicationsâ€”were a particularly important in this. A range of arts parodied and undermined the Tokugawa regime though indirect criticism of things such as social classes and history that it and other powerful groups used to legitimate their authority. Some artists saw themselves as members of a brotherhood that embraced the frivolous yet valued traditional Edo culture; others may have genuinely had revolution in mind at a time when it was clear that society was undergoing rapid and violent change. The relationship between Edo period genres was often fluid, so one art could easily be embellished then inspire the next. This had important implications for materiality as regards performance, text, and image. Importantly, this panel looks at traditions in the two major urban centersâ€”Edo and Osakaâ€”showing that there were key regional differences in arts that need to be taken into consideration when accessing Edo period cultures, those comical or not. "
30,Julia Alekseyeva,Season of Image Politics: Japanese Visual Media in 1968 ,"The student and labor protests of 1968 were a global movement, stretching from Paris to Tokyo, New York to Prague. Japan's experience of this turbulent era-- what Yuriko Furuhata termed the  season of image politics-- is reflected in its rich history of visual media, including film, television, visual art, theatre, and photography. Through figures such as filmmakers Oshima Nagisa, Suzuki Seijun, Hani Susumu, and Wakamatsu Koji, photographer Nakahira Takuma and graphic designer Yokoo Tadanori, 1968 came to index not only student and labor movements, but a mode of thought. This interdisciplinary panel investigates how visual media bear witness to 1968 as a major global event, a locus of human rights struggles, and a definitive moment in the history of film, television, and other media.   Will Carroll investigates differing interpretations of the controversial filmmaker Suzuki Seijun in 1968, as either a champion of the New Left, or an esoteric formalist. Julia Alekseyeva delves into two tendencies-- serious Brechtian alienation or comedic playfulness-- dominating the multidisciplinary projects of the Art Theatre Guild. Finally, Takuya Tsunoda analyzes several television programs of the 1960s, including animation and televisual tourism, which highlight a new way of thinking about 1968 as a new media moment. The 50th anniversary of 1968 allows us to place this immensely fruitful and turbulent year into context with the contemporary age. In so doing, this panel will illuminate 1968 Japan as both a historical event, and a mode of thought-- at times contradictory, but no less radical and revolutionary. "
31,Anne Giblin Gedacht,"Harnessing Manchurian Imaginaries in the Japanese Empire, 1930-1945 ","In Japan's Total Empire, Louise Young remarks  when Manchukuo caught a cold, Japan sneezed. (14)  This panel contends that  Manchuria had a potent figurative power that permeated the Japanese metropole beyond state-sponsored economic projects or the promotion of a singular nationalism. Instead, the imaginary of Manchuria took on a life of its own, becoming the foundation of narratives that sometimes overlapped and sometimes conflicted with the nationalist vision. Examining four cultural projects that mobilized the malleable discourse of  Manchuria, these papers showcase new research on how Japanese artists, regional intellectuals, policy makers, and minorities all employed the idea and ideal of Manchuria for their own ends. Anne Giblin Gedacht discusses how residents of a marginalized area in northeastern Japan highlighted their role as settlers in Manchuria to bolster regional prestige and their contribution to the wider nationalist project. Kari Shepherdson-Scott shows how Japanese art photographers romanticized Manchuria as rural idyll of agricultural development through the cultural lens of the nineteenth-century French Barbizon School. Evan Wells examines how narratives surrounding a seemingly prosaic Manchurian agricultural product, the soybean, can reveal the shifting priorities of policymakers in imagining Manchuria's relationship with Greater Japan. Finally, James Homsey explores how minority populations in Japan co-opted the Army's ideal of ""harmony of the five races"" in Manchuria to make demands of the Army-led state's nation-building project at home. Ultimately, this panel illustrates the unexpected, and sometimes subversive, ways Japanese actors adapted the flexible idea of  Manchuria to serve their respective desires and goals. "

34,Malgorzata K. Citko,Manuscripts and Transmission of Knowledge: Textual Instability in Premodern ,"Textual instability is a key feature of literary works of the ancient and medieval periods, based on the transmission of these texts through hand-brushed copies. Texts in premodern Japan were received and modifiedâ€”replaced, miscopied, corrected, negotiated, and transformed, as shown by scholars such as Kenneth Butler, Joshua Mostow, Jamie Newhard and Michael Emmerich. Thus, for centuries there tended to be no single authoritative textual version. As Michael Brownstein and Haruo Shirane have argued, the notion of canonical texts and the development of a national literature with a stable literary canon took hold during Meiji-era modernization, with an emphasis on textual singularity being a notable feature. The fluidity of premodern texts was thus not a  problem until it challenged the new sense of authoritative knowledge being constructed in a modern age. This panel brings together three papers dealing with textual variability in premodern Japan and the Ryukyu Kingdom to reconsider manuscript cultures and channels of knowledge transmission. Malgorzata Citko demonstrates that medieval reception of an ancient poetic classic, the Man'yshÅ« (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) differs significantly from its contemporary one. Robert Huey examines, among other texts, a 16th-century manuscript of Ise monogatari (Tales of Ise), probing gaps in our understanding of how texts were transmitted within the kingdom, and between Ryukyu and Japan. Kei Umeda shows how perceptions of premodernity influenced the categorization of works in the late Edo-era index of the Gunsho ruijÅ« (Classified Collection of Japanese Classics). "

Participants will discuss the increasing primacy of digital scholarship throughout Japanese studies and examine NCC's future role as a catalyst in collaborative efforts to make Japanese resources and digital scholarship broadly accessible. Since 1991, NCC has worked across institutions and disciplines, developing cooperative collections, advocating for access to digital databases, and forging partnerships among faculty, librarians, and technical specialists to nurture new expertise. This roundtable brings together scholars and librarians who are actively engaged in collaborative digital scholarship and services and who are working with NCC to chart new directions in developing and making digital services available globally in years to come. Robert Campbell, Director-General at the National Institute of Japanese Literature (NIJL) in Tokyo, will present on the digital projects NIJL is currently spearheading in collaboration with domestic and overseas research universities, including  Project to Build an International Collaborative Research Network for Pre-modern Japanese Texts. Thomas Conlan, Professor of Japanese History at Princeton University, will introduce his website and ongoing multimedia projects, where he is developing a shared knowledge base through digital collaboration. Robin Le Blanc, Professor of Government at Washington and Lee University, will examine NCC's IUP (Image Use Protocol) and discuss the new challenges involved in developing a protocol for the moving image. Toshie Marra, Japanese Collection Librarian at UC Berkeley, will describe Berkeley's ongoing collaborative digitization projects with Japanese libraries, and Regan Murphy Kao, Curator of the East Asia Library Special Collections at Stanford University, will discuss the various digital initiatives that Stanford Libraries is pursuing and their possible applications for scholars in Japanese Studies.  This interactive roundtable will be moderated to encourage lively discussion amongst the panelists, as well as active participation from the audience.  "
36,Colin Jones,A Disciplinary Perspective on Postwar Japan ,"The years immediately after 1945 are frequently portrayed as a moment of democratization undercut by the preservation of the country's conservative political and business elite. By canvassing the problems the transition from war to peace and democracy posed to four different academic disciplines, we seek to find new frameworks for understanding this pivotal era. Hiromu Nagahara explores the mercurial career of music critic Sonobe Sabur, who remapped his wartime conception of Japanese music onto a booming popular music culture after 1945. Matthieu Felt reconstructs a fierce postwar debate about the meaning of traditional Japanese literature, showing how it gave rise to an understanding of the canon as a depoliticized literature centered on the uniqueness of Japanese aesthetics and expression. Focusing on the racial anxieties raised by the konketsuji ( mixed-blood children) of Allied servicemen and Japanese mothers, Kristin Roebuck highlights the surprising prevalence of eugenics discourse after WWII. Colin Jones explains why a group of prominent law professors who embraced fascism in the 1930s emerged after 1945 as some of the most vocal proponents of the postwar constiuttion. "
37,Emi F. Bushelle,Overcoming Nativism: New Approaches to Discourses of Identity in Japanese History ,"Over the last three decades, the idea that the intellectual movement known in Japanese as Kokugaku is properly understood as  nativism has acquired widespread acceptance. The term, however, is rarely defined with precision and consequently has come to be understood as a kind of nationalism before the advent of the modern nation-state, a connotation that runs counter to its use in American history and our current political discourse. Even more problematic is its implied reification of the category of identity; for discourses on identity in premodern Japan were often inferences following from, rather than founding predicates of, particular cosmological, religious, and historical understandings of the world. Nonetheless, recent studies have argued for the relevance of  nativism as a category for interpreting any affirmation of the land and people of Japan. This panel seeks to overcome the interpretive limitations of nativism by exploring alternative approaches to the study of Japanese identity from the Heian to the Meiji periods. Kanagawa highlights the valorization of the foreign in a Heian-period official genealogy. Bushelle traces the roots of Kokugaku identity discourse to medieval Buddhist naturalism. McNally argues that the legendary founding of the RyÅ«kyÅ« Kingdom by Minamoto no Tametomo, widely accepted during the Edo period, provided a concrete example of a society that was neither completely foreign nor completely Japanese. Wachutka elucidates the new self-identity of Meiji-period Kokugaku vis-Ã -vis its Edo-period predecessor and its challenge to society's overt Westernization. Finally, Wehmeyer brings expertise in Kokugaku and historical linguistics to comment from an interdisciplinary perspective. "
38,Lindsay Nelson,"Haunted Spaces: Reimagining Ghosts, Monsters, and Trauma Across Japanese ","What role does art play in the processing of trauma and terrifying events? This panel brings together research on rakugo, Japanese visual / performance art, and Japanese cinema to explore the changing ways that trauma, reality, and fiction interface across different media forms. Lauri Kitsnik examines the aesthetic space of Shind Kaneto's Onibaba, locating it within a long tradition of Japanese ghost films and also revealing the link between the film's fictional space of terror and its bare-bones production conditions. Katherine Mezur focuses on a space of   fearful transfiguration in the animal-human characters of four contemporary Japanese artists to show the often thin line between kawaii and disturbing ""animations."" Lindsay Nelson examines the question of who owns the haunted space of Aokigahara, Japan's  suicide forest, which exists as both a real site of ongoing tragedy and a source of inspiration for horror narratives. Finally, Esra Gokce Sahin analyzes the space where humor meets fear and uncertainty, focusing on rakugo performances in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster and how a particular story, Shinigami, took on new resonance after Fukushima. In examining how these haunted spaces of ghost stories, uncanny-cute characters, suicide, and nuclear disaster are portrayed across a range of media, we will explore the ways that art cracks open our perception of trauma, challenging us toward an activist encounter with dark subject matter. "
39,George T. Sipos,Coerced Beliefs and Willing Conversions: Tenko Literature in Pre- and Postwar ,"The debate is still open as to whether Japan's 1930s-1940s tenk (coerced ideological conversion) of anti-kokutai activists was a unique phenomenon in Japan and elsewhere, a social experiment in oppression in which state authorities, and societal and personal pressures alike, led to a public mass ideological conversion of almost all of Japan's leftist organizations' members and to their declarative  re-integration in the  family state. This panel proposes not only a re-opening of the discussion about tenk through literary narratives produced by the  converted writers of the time, but also a bridge, for comparison purposes, with the more or less willing conversion of the postwar period of the student movement activists, in the 1960s and 70s. The presentations in the panel focus on distinct albeit intertwined kinds of narratives. From the repositioning of the family trope in the literature of the 1930s tenk, a salient one given the insistence of the official state discourse on the importance of both the family state and the modern nuclear family as pillars of Japan's modernity, to the specific case of the tenk writer par excellence, Shimaki Kensaku, and his own take on the wartime  return to Japan discourse, and finally to individual self-negation in the literary works of former student movement activists, such as Shji Kaoru and Mita Masahiroâ€”an absolute expression of willing ideological conversionâ€”the panel creates an inter-generational bridge through works of literature, in an attempt to unite the two historical moments, as well as re-evaluate their differences. "
40,Kristine Dennehy,Bringing the Archives of Wartime and Occupied Japan to Life: Perspectives from the ,"This panel brings together several different approaches to Japanese archival materials from the wartime and occupation periods (ca. 1940-1952). As a graduate student in the field of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Eric Siercks focuses on documents in the Prange Collection generated by censors in early postwar Tohoku and Hokkaido as a way to analyze the interplay between individual censors and the broader policies of the Allied forces. Eric Van Slander complements this reading of the Prange Collection documents with an archivist's intimate knowledge of related administrative records held in the National Archives. Such insights are crucial in the process of successfully accessing and effectively utilizing these kinds of primary sources for future research projects. Yoko Nagasaka Myers provides another perspective from the private sector with an overview of the collaborative work she has done with the Japanese government as well as other academics to uncover records related to the Battle of Iwo Jima. Finally, Kristine Dennehy will introduce ways that English-language primary source evidence from occupied Japan can be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses as a way to expand the geographic scope of inquiry in classes ranging from world history surveys to seminars in historical methodology. Discussant Yasuko Hassall Kobayashi, with institutional affiliations in Japan and Australia, will provide commentary based on her expertise and research into military intelligence reports (including interrogations of Japanese POWs) from the Allied Translator and Intelligence Service (ATIS), generated by Australian and American forces during World War II. "
41,Livia Rodica Monnet,"Towards an Ecosophical Approach to Nuclear Ecologies : Reading Time, Irradiated ","This panel examines three interrelated issues pertaining to the ethico-aesthetics of the nuclear : temporality; irradiated bodies; and nuclear affect (as one aspect of the larger problematic of the production of nuclear subjectivity). These questions are probed  in close readings of recent Japanese fiction, manga, photography, and film. Of primary interest in these readings are less the ongoing legacies of major nuclear events such as the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or the Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns (though these legacies are discussed), but whar might be called an ecosophical approach  to nuclear ecologies that instigates transversal junctions between technoscience, politics, culture, and social movements (Guattari, Chaosmosis). Examining the depiction of radiation-induced illness in several popular manga, Yuki Miyamoto's paper argues that biopolitics serves to normalize the slow violence of radiation exposure by legitimizing certain illnesses and deaths while ostracizing the irradiated body. Davre maps the visualization of human, nuclear, and photographic memory, and the latter's animation by radioactive half-life and the (limited) duration of the daguerreotype plate in selected images from two recent series of daguerreotypes by artist Arai Takashi. Beth examines the imaging of the contraction of time, and the articulation of a potential futurity of sociopolitical transformation in Matsue Tetsuaki's film Tokyo Drifter. Finally, Monnet argues that Tsushima Yuko's story Celebrating Cesium 137's Half-Life suggests that the potential for revolution against totalitarian nuclear capitalism is immanent in the lived virtuality of nuclear ecologies. "
42,Mire Koikari,Deep Militarization: Okinawa and Dynamics of Militarism Beyond the Fences ,"This panel explores what we call  deep militarization, a historical process whereby the dynamics of militarism goes beyond the  fences to circulate across and penetrate into various social spheres. Challenging and complicating the U.S.-base-centered analysis of power and resistance, we aim to establish an expanded analytical framework for critical Okinawan studies, a framework that addresses the intersecting web of social actors, economic practices, cultural institutions, and political processes that sustain militarization outside the military. Our approach is historically sensitive, as it rethinks and reimagines the contours and contents of militarization in Okinawa whose origin goes back to (even before) the Cold War and whose contemporary articulation is inseparable from post-Cold War globalization. Our framework is also interdisciplinary, drawing on analytical insights in History, Anthropology, Ethnomusicology, and Gender Studies to examine, for instance, new technologies of social control, politics of cultural preservation, and soundscape of militarization. More specifically, Tze May Loo will discuss the politics of cultural heritage during the US occupation of Okinawa. Yuan Yu Kuan will examine the soundscape of contemporary Yonaguni where the Japanese Self-Defense Forces exerts visible presence. Masamichi Inoue will focus on the increasing securitization surrounding anti-US base protest movements and its consequences. Chris Nelson will explore the activities of an Okinawan NGO whose objective is centered on the excavation and preservation of war memories. Following these presentations, Mire Koikari will discuss the ways in which these four papers suggest alternative approaches to critical studies of Okinawa in the age of militarism and globalism. "

45,Eric Cunningham,"Forests, Agriculture, and Oceans: Rurality and the Political Economy of Nature in ","This panel explores the ways in which spaces and objects usually associated with nature and the rural in Japan are cast and recast as sources of economic value and alternative futures. While modern Japan might be best known for high-tech goods, there remains significant economic activity derived from interactions with forests, agricultural lands, and oceans. These activities carry with them symbolic meaning and are often tied to traditions that reach back in time. This session explores the ways in which different groups engage with these spaces and considers how they are conceptualized, imagined, and materially configured. In particular, participants examine the entanglements and subjectivities that emerge as people seek to intervene and reimagine rural spaces and their associated objects. Three of the papers deal with the 3.11 disasters, which has been a fulcrum for attempts to reconfigure Japan's Tohoku region. Specifically, these papers look at how the economic potential of the ocean is reimagined after the nuclear disaster with wind farms; how urbanites who moved to Tohoku after 3.11 bring with them new ideas about the economic futures of rural spaces; and in the strategies to revalorize agricultural products from Fukushima prefecture. A fourth paper considers how forests in Nagano prefecture are recast alongside dam building projects as national resources that support modern economic activity in urban locales. Our examinations of efforts to configure spaces and objects deemed rural and/or natural contribute to contemporary debates about the  decline of peripheral spaces and the effects of the 3.11 disasters. "
46,Timon Screech,The Issue of â€˜Openness' in Early-Edo Political Culture ,"This panel brings together five scholars of 17th-century Japan who have undertaken their studies in different academic traditions. The binding theme of the panel is the concept â€˜openness.' This term is selected to be deliberately provocative, since the period is more often defined as withdrawal from international affairs, then â€˜national isolation' (sakoku). The panel will argue that this interpretation is worth reconsideration. We do not â€˜reopen the question of sakoku', which has been done before, but investigate certain threads and features which allow alternative directions in Edo culture to appear. We begin from the treatment of historic space, and reallocation of landmarks by Tokugawa Ieyasu; we then turn to the embededness of the shogunate in Edo, and assess the way in which this notionallyâ€“remote location was, conversely, represented as part of international normative politics. Two further papers look at collecting of foreign objects, taking two case studies: commissions for Korean ceramics placed with the Japan House in Pusan, and the private collection of Western objects amassed by the shogunal councilor Inoue Masashige. "
47,Jan Bardsley,Cold War Era Cultural Alliances and Gendered Nationalism in Japan ,"Building on recent interventions in Cold War scholarship on Japan informed by feminist theory and women's history (Koikari, Sherif, Yano, Yoneyama), our panel looks beyond treaties and military strategy to examine the intersection of gender, social status, and ethno-nationalism in popular culture. Taking up key social phenomena in Japanâ€”fashion shows, milk campaigns, feminist memoir, and literary fandomâ€”we explore constructions of Cold War gender ideologies as entwining notions of national health, security, social mobility, and economic success. Bardsley investigates Tokyo's 1950s fashion runways as high-status Cold War contact zones pitting New York tastemakers against Japanese displays of  native charm and incipient women's liberation.  Analyzing advertising campaigns surrounding  pure, healthy Japanese milk, Horiguchi examines how the production and consumption of dairy products and the visual narratives promoting them in the 1950s-60s shapes strong, gendered bodies as worthy allies of the U.S. Bullock takes up the career of French culture  expert Asabuki Tomiko, who capitalized on postwar Japanese desires for social mobility by positing Franceâ€”rather than the U.S., Japan's Cold War mentor and  protectorâ€” as an alternate site of longing and emancipation. Exploring Cold War after-effects, Hirakawa contrasts feminist and masculinist fan readings of Anne of Green Gables, analyzing women's aspirations for emancipation and masculinist articulations of  figting for Japan.  Discussant Sherif engages our audience, asking: How did grand narratives of Cold War Japan incite nativist, feminist, and masculinist discourse? How did they construct competing notions of emancipation and citizenship? What Cold War cultural legacies influence Japanese discourse on gender today? "
48,Wei-ti Chen,The Japanese Empire and Its Non-National Actors ,"This panel joins the already rich discussion on relations among the colonized peoples of the Japanese empire (1868-1945) by focusing on episodes of conflict, cooperation and migration authored by subnational and transnational actors. Soldiers, civilians, professionals, teachers, youth, and indigenous peoples, who are the subjects of these four papers, forged ambivalent identities, paths of mobility, and sites of contested memories that outlived the empire. Because these episodes challenge the field's structuring meta-narratives of economic development, nation-building, and class-formation, they command our attention and their effects continue to reverberate in contemporary Asia.   The panel considers how modern institutionsâ€”conscript military, universal education, professionalized medicine, and national mediaâ€”intensified and extensified contacts among collectivities newly incorporated into the Japanese empire. Barclay examines the disconnect between an imperial capitalist economy premised on movement and an imperial state that institutionalized autochthony as a site of modern identity. Chen examines the construction of ethnic hierarchy in medical society and how Taiwanese and Koreans used migration to advance their career opportunities to avoid facing discrimination as members of the local colonized population. Hu's research on Japanese teachers in Taiwan suggests that colonial education stimulated the emergence of a more inclusive imperial culture and networks. Lastly, by examining the actions of the members of the first unit of the Taiwanese Aborigine Volunteer Army who fought in the Philippines, Ziomek argues that the horrors of war obliterated typical colonial hierarchies and assumptions. Ethan Mark, a historian of Japanese-Asian colonial and wartime interactions, will be the chair and discussant. "
49,Laura Hein,Writing Japanese History for the Cambridge History of Japan ,"What challenges inherent to the genre itself emerge when producing a new edition of the Cambridge History of Japan? One construct we have retained is  premodern, early modern, and modern, even though doing so radically foreshortens the internally complex first millennium of Japanese history. Cambridge Histories assume the centrality of political history, but this concept already misrepresents the evolving nature of authority in Japanese history, especially premodern history. Although it is more relevant for early modern and modern history, the boundaries of  the political far exceed formal governmental processes in those eras, too. We put this problem of incommensurability front and center in Volume 1 and organize Volumes 2 and 3 in ways that highlight how political authority was shaped by other kinds of power. For example, we group warfare with economic and environmental change to emphasize two things: the conflicts were frequently over resources and their resolutions regularly transformed society in diverse ways. This Cambridge History, as is standard, is nation-centered, even though recent scholarship has emphasized both the ways that the boundaries of  Japan shifted over time and how porous and entangled those boundaries were even when geographically stable. The inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago also created distinctive regional cultures. We have asked each contributor to engage this problem, in order to convey the multiplicity of ways that Japanese history is only comprehensible within transnational, global, entangled, and translocal histories. "
50,Simon Kaner,The Art of Heritage: Transnational and Interdisciplinary Approaches ,"In their recent book, Matsuda and Mengoni questioned the applicability of the concept of â€˜cultural heritage' in East Asian contexts. From UNESCO World Heritage to local heritage initiatives (for example the Japan Heritage or â€˜Nihon isan' programme promoting cultural tourism in the lead-up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics), however, the â€˜stuff' of heritage across Asia is being scrutinised on an unprecedented scale, with new generations of â€˜heritage practitioners' being trained up, while politicians and other activists in some countries are openly hostile towards traditional curators and approaches to managing the heritage (I am thinking here of David Atkinson's interventions in Japan). This panel addresses issues that lead to potential confrontations at disciplinary boundaries with much of what falls within the rubric of â€˜cultural heritage' cross-cutting traditional academic fields including history, art, art history, architectural history, conservation, and museology, adding into the mix cultural politics and soft diplomacy, the economics of tourism, environmental concerns and digital humanities. At the same time, the narratives involved in heritage are often necessarily transnational: the specific agendas of national state parties notwithstanding, the evaluation of World Heritage nominations depends on the demonstration of Outstanding Universal Value; and shared concerns with the preservation and interpretation of heritage assets at the local level can provide new frameworks for engagement, comparison and cooperation by diverse communities. Presentations in the panel will consider these concerns through a series of specific case studies. "
51,Hansun Hsiung,"Early Modern Science, State and Society: Toward the Forthcoming Cambridge ","Forty-one years have passed since Marius Jansen and John Whitney Hall began labor on  a multi-volume history series on Japan; approximately twenty-seven years since volumes four and five of the Cambridge History of Japan -- Early Modern Japan and The Nineteenth Century -- finally achieved publication. In their time, Hall and Jansen spoke of an authoritative Anglophone source that might generate  discussions of comparative history in terms of feudalism, modernization, development, [and] Westernization. Today, a new set of historiographical priorities shape scholarship: explorations of science and environment, of medicine and the body; entangled accounts of Japan within transnational vectors of ideas and artifacts; analyses of dynamic syncretism that provincialize the alleged shock of  Western encounter. Gathering together contributors to the second volume of the rebooted Cambridge History of Japan (forthcoming 2020), this roundtable opens a conversation on the future of early modern Japanese history, with a stress on intellectual history, the history of science, and the history of medicine. Each presenter offers a five-minute provocation outlining how their respective chapters will reinvigorate the study of Japan in relation to broader movements in academic research. Of particular interest will be communication with scholars outside the Japan field, thus breaking through nationally-entrenched research traditions. Susan Burns problematizes the division between  elite versus  popular understandings of the body by tracing the emergence of a  vernacular medical knowledge at the intersection of the medical marketplace and commercial print. Yulia Frumer reconceptualizes Tokugawa science outside the  Chinese vs. Western binary through a focus on practices of depiction, measurement, and translation. Similarly, Hansun Hsiung decenters Europe in histories of Rangaku by highlighting Southeast and East Asian flows of texts and instruments. Federico Marcon, meanwhile, challenges us to symmetrically recuperate the word  philosophy to understand the discourse of professional jusha. Finally, Kiri Paramore combines new trends in global history, comparative political thought, and East Asian history to map the nexus of knowledge, governance, and publicness in Tokugawa society. Through this dialogue, we seek to create chapters that, in the tradition of the Cambridge History series, will become an indispensable resource for specialists, non-specialists, and students alike. "
52,Ranny Rastati,Islam and Japan Pop Culture ,"Japan popular culture has for decades attract the world especially in Southeast Asia countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. As predominant Muslim countries, young generation in Indonesia and Malaysia spent their childhood with manga and anime pop culture without neglecting their religious values. Young Muslim sees Japanese popular culture as a fascinating phenomenon where Islamic practices are negotiated to make way for their passion for the culture. Islamic manga, hijab cosplay, Japan-themed Indonesian Islamic literature, and Halal food are some of the examples of conformity between community expressions of Islamic values and Japan popular culture.  It is proposed that the session will have its focus on the fusion phenomenon between Islamic values and Japan popular culture, drawing case studies from  Indonesia and Malaysia. Nasir investigates the production of Malaysian manga in terms of modes of Islamic representation, where Islam is viewed as part of Malaysian identity. Rastati examines the new phenomenon in Indonesia called hijab cosplay, where Hijab-wearing cosplayer cosplays without taking off the hijab. This becomes a marker of religious obedience while embracing Japanese popular culture. Pratama looks at the representation of Japan and Japanese in Islamic novel in Indonesia, on how the element of Japan is negotiated with Islamic identity. Masami examines the new food culture that comes from Middle Eastern countries or Islamic religious culture that is Halal Food and the concept of Omotenashi or a culture of Japanese hospitality between the seller and the buyer. "
53,Hiromi Miyagi-Lusthaus,Leaving Our â€˜Comfort Zone': Incorporating Social Justice in East Asian (Japanese) ,"Social justice has been long neglected in the field of foreign language education, where teaching cultural knowledge and linguistic proficiency is often emphasized. Since social justice issues sometimes cast a culture in a negative light, East Asian language classes have tended to treat the subject as taboo. However, as Japan and the world in general become increasingly diverse, we believe that including such topics in Asian language education is important for nurturing global citizens. Moreover, lessons dealing with social justice would provide students with opportunities to deepen their understanding of culture and society, the target culture's as well as their own. Current pedagogical research remains primarily focused on linguistic proficiency and cultural competency development. While some Japanese educators have proposed promoting critical thinking concerning stereotypes, ideologies, and inequality in gender and ethnicity in Japanese classes (Doerr and Kumagai 2014, Kubota 2003, McPherson 2012, Ohara, et.al, 1999, Sugimori 2015), many teachers may hesitate to introduce this area without proper training and pedagogical tools. Crookes (2009) suggests that more material development in this field would be helpful to teachers who are interested in creating social justice components to include in their classes. This panel will (1) present a discussion of why the social justice should be included in East Asian language education along with (2) a case study conducted to raise consciousness about stereotyping that utilized dialogues in a popular textbook for the elementary levels, and (3) explore ways teachers might be trained to incorporate social justice issues in Japanese language classrooms. "
54,Christopher A. Born,Competing Narratives of Victimhood and Aggression: The Enduring Effects of ,"The conclusion of the Pacific War witnessed the emergence of contradictory narratives that soon competed for ownership of Japan's official wartime memory. As ardent nationalism was replaced with pacifism and a global outlook, Japan's total military defeat was largely refigured into a narrative of victimhood. Simultaneously, the aggression of the past was purposefully downplayed. Indeed, how is it possible to be at once aggressor and victim? This interdisciplinary panel of international scholars highlights the contradictory complexities of wartime memories in postwar Japanese society, and how competing narratives continue to shape domestic and international politics. Using Sakae Tsuboi's novel Twenty-four Eyes (1952) as a lens, Shobichatul Aminah begins our discussion of the victim-aggressor dichotomy and calls attention to the bifurcated spirit of nationalism and pacifism that emerged after the war. Next, sociologist Masaya Nemoto problematizes the double-victim status of atom-bomb survivors, and how, despite their criticism of Japan's wartime actions, their narratives have been coopted by those in power for their own aims. Finally, political scientists Benjamin San Jose and Carmina Untalan examine how Kyo Machiko's recent manga, Attack of the Killer Strawberries,reveals the mechanisms employed in the legitimization of Japan's narrative of  victimhood that still interferes with international relations, while also calling attention to the dangers of war to a generation far removed from the horrors of the past.  Marvin Marcus, a senior scholar of modern Japanese literature, will provide concluding remarks before opening the panel to audience participation. "
55,Sachiko Kawai,Staying Afloat: Creative Social Networking Practices in Medieval Japan ,"Kinship was a source of alliance and conflict throughout Japan's medieval times (c. 1050-1600). Expanding familial ties was a crucial strategy used to survive in this unstable era fraught with political and military struggles. This panel explores both biological and non-biological human networks developed by various social groups as a means for empowerment. These ties were complicated arrangements which often brought competing interests together. To encourage comparative perspectives, this panel offers substantial feedback from a China specialist on the three Japan focused papers and investigates kinship relations in a broader East Asian context. Sachiko Kawai argues that despite lacking their own military offices, early medieval royal women gained military power through the use of adoptions and human resources gathered from their landholdings. Through his case studies of thirteenth and fourteenth century warrior families, Kevin Gouge reveals that non-biological kin relations were as crucial as blood ties to sustain power. By investigating the survival strategies of warriors during the sixteenth and early seventeenth century civil war, David Spafford shows how the meaning of  elite was transformed and how changes in gender roles and marriage patterns shaped medieval power wielding mechanisms. Nick Tackett, a historian of medieval China and the panel discussant, provides comparative commentaries on the three papers in a wider East Asian context. Through this process, we hope to invite fresh questions and enliven the discussion session with the audience. "
56,Alexander Bukh,Conservative Activism in Post-War Japan ,"Conservative activism has been an important element of post-war Japan's politics. Nevertheless, the extent academic literature on social activism in Japan, generally tends to exclude movements that do not fall within the liberal conception of civil society from its scope of analysis. This inter-disciplinary panel seeks to partially address this lacuna by analyzing a number of important instances of conservative activism in the early post-war period. Masuda's paper re-examines postwar Japan's social conservative backlash as a  decolonization process, focusing on the role played by ordinary people as well as their everyday struggles and conflicts concerning  purity and  stability at home. Hofmann's paper focuses on post-1945 Japanese anticommunist activism. It argues that anticommunism offered Japanese conservatives a repertoire of strategies to shape the domestic and international order at a time when the country moved from empire to nation-state under American tutelage. Zwigenberg explores the Kokura castle liberation movement as a unique case of conservative, urban anti- base movement. It argues that castle building in general, and the Kokura movement in particular, was a part of a country wide conservative reaction to what was seen as the Japan's perceived loss of tradition during the occupation. Bukh's paper concludes the session by examining the grassroots activism related to Soviet and South Korea occupied territories. It argues that the two movements have shared a number of important similarities with other social movements in post-war Japan and their emergence can be contributed to the political and legal reforms enacted by the occupation authorities. "
57,William Bridges,"Anime Pedagogies: Students, Scholars, Fans, Creators ","There are  forms of educationalâ€_activity, Martha Nussbaum writes, for which  certain literary texts (or texts similar to these in certain relevant ways) are indispensable.  This panel is premised on Nussbaum's parenthetical: anime is certainly relevantâ€”perhaps even indispensableâ€”to the contemporary Asian Studies curriculum.  In the sixteen years since Susan Napier began her groundbreaking study with the question  why anime, classrooms throughout the English-speaking academy have responded: because anime brings to life the very best of humanistic study (expanding imaginative capacity, opening possible worlds, enhancing media literacy, etc). What is the pedagogical power of anime, and how might this pedagogical potential be best realized?  We assume that a focus on pedagogy is central to restoring public recognition of the value of the humanities, with  pedagogy defined broadly to include the role of anime in the Asian Studies curriculum as well as what anime texts, and their creative reception by students, teach us as scholars.  Bridges considers the devoured humans of Attack on Titan as a metaphor for the crises in the humanities/humanity.  Raine explores the complex (dis-)identifications that underpin the reception of some anime texts outside of Japan, and outside of Asian Studies.  Yoda discusses the ethical pedagogy of Mawaru Penguindrum, an anime that alludes to the urban attack perpetrated by millenarian cult Aum Shinriky.  Lamarre will discuss the pedagogical promise and peril of handling non-discrete objects.  In concert, the papers address what students and scholars of anime have to learn from this pedagogically-rich medium. "
58,Franziska Seraphim,TimeSpace in Japan's Long 20th Century: Approaches to the New Cambridge ,"The new Cambridge History of Japan takes up a range of thematic chapters that are new in historical and geographical scope for this genre. Contributors to the 20th-century volume share the challenge of conceptualizing their topics across the momentous political transformations from empire and war to postwar (global) integration up to the post-Fukushima present. What does Japan's historical experience look like if the usual state-centeredness is both sized up and broken down as part of wider global dynamics? This roundtable discussion is a crucial forum for contributors to compare their approaches and involve an audience of potential readers in establishing their metanarratives. Mark Metzler surveys INDUSTRIALIZATION as social and ecological process. The historic scaling up of material and energy flows within Japan transformed regional divisions of labor and widened Japan's ecological footprint. The developmental frontier Japan had already reached by the 1930s suggests a new reading of the great slowing of recent decades. Hiromi Mizuno examines AGRARIAN POPULATION's dynamic mobility (colonization, emigration, postwar land development), challenges the conventional chronology, and proposes a new narrative for Japanese industrialization and  development of the 20th century. Jordan Sand explores how the chronology of the CITY and of the nation-state overlap and diverge. The history of industrial-era cities may appear inseparable from the state when we focus on economic growth, yet urban culture and lifestyles before the 1970s distanced cities from the rest of the country. Vera Mackie considers state regulation of GENDER AND SEXUALITY through important historical turning points related to the acquisition of suffrage for men and women, the gradual removal of restrictions on women's political activity, and the changing regimes of the management of population and family forms. Franziska Seraphim understands SOCIAL MOVEMENTS as sustained public protest against perceived systemic inequities that manifested with respect to territory and place, capitalist relations, social inclusion and exclusion, and the norms associated with  modernity and later  globalization. Edward Lincoln, as moderator, will add his insights in how to situate the BUBBLE ERA (1987-1991), which marked a crucial transition from a century of rapid industrialization to one of a mature economy beset with a wholly new set of issues and problems. "
59,Jamyung Choi,Being Professional in Modern Japan ,"Even as their authority rested on claims to expertise in narrow fields, professionals in Japan used their position to shape society as a whole. By developing and consolidating professional privilege, and then transforming this privilege into broad social and cultural capital, university-educated Buddhist priests, white-collar engineers, and cosmopolitan lawyers placed themselves at the center of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Japanese social and political history.  By examining such professional groups, this panel takes the study of Japanese professions in new directions. Montrose's work expands the study of professions to religious actors, who have been eclipsed in the studies of professions associated with science. She does so by tracing the professionalization of the Buddhist priesthood and its effect on the reshaping of Buddhism and the development of religious education for the modern era. Choi examines the professionalization of engineers as more than the social ascent of a historically scorned occupational group. He sees the professionalization of engineering as a multi-layered process involving both top engineers and manual workers and explores the construction of a collar line in this process. Flaherty charts new territory in the transnational dimension of professions by exploring how legal professionals negotiated Japanese, Asian, and putatively universal notions of law during the 1920s. While reconsidering underlying assumptions in the study of professions about the importance of science, merit, and privilege, the papers analyze professional change in imperial Japan through its local and global connections.  "
