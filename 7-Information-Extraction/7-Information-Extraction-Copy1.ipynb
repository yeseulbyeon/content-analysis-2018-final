    "# Week 7 - Information Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we move from arbitrary textual classification to the use of computation and linguistic models to parse precise claims from documents. Rather than focusing on simply the *ideas* in a corpus, here we focus on understanding and extracting its precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases, like the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triples we extract here. While much of this can be done directly in the python package NLTK that we introduced in week 2, here we use NLTK bindings to the Stanford NLP group's open software, written in Java. Try typing a sentence into the online version [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/corenlp/) to get a sense of its potential. It is superior in performance to NLTK's implementations, but takes time to run, and so for these exercises we will parse and extract information for a very small text corpus. Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",

    "Open Information Extraction is a module packaged within the Stanford Core NLP package, but it is not yet supported by `nltk`. As a result, we have defining our own `lucem_illud` function that runs the Stanford Core NLP java code right here. For other projects, it is often useful to use Java or other programs (in C, C++) within a python workflow, and this is an example. `stanford.openIE()` takes in a string or list of strings and then produces as output all the subject, verb, object (SVO) triples Stanford Corenlp can find, as a DataFrame. You can do this through links to the Stanford Core NLP project that we provide here, or play with their interface directly (in the penultimate cell of this notebook), which produces data in \"pretty graphics\" like this example parsing of the first sentence in the \"Shooting of Trayvon Martin\" Wikipedia article:\n",

    "Dependency parsing was developed to robustly capture linguistic dependencies from text. The complex tags associated with these parses are detailed [here]('http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/syntax.html'). When parsing with the dependency parser, we will work directly from the untokenized text. Note that no *processing* takes place before parsing sentences--we do not remove so-called stop words or anything that plays a syntactic role in the sentence, although anaphora resolution and related normalization may be performed before or after parsing to enhance the value of information extraction.
