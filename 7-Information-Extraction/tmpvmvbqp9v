Even as their authority rested on claims to expertise in narrow fields, professionals in Japan used their position to shape society as a whole. By developing and consolidating professional privilege, and then transforming this privilege into broad social and cultural capital, university-educated Buddhist priests, white-collar engineers, and cosmopolitan lawyers placed themselves at the center of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Japanese social and political history.  By examining such professional groups, this panel takes the study of Japanese professions in new directions. Montrose's work expands the study of professions to religious actors, who have been eclipsed in the studies of professions associated with science. She does so by tracing the professionalization of the Buddhist priesthood and its effect on the reshaping of Buddhism and the development of religious education for the modern era. Choi examines the professionalization of engineers as more than the social ascent of a historically scorned occupational group. He sees the professionalization of engineering as a multi-layered process involving both top engineers and manual workers and explores the construction of a collar line in this process. Flaherty charts new territory in the transnational dimension of professions by exploring how legal professionals negotiated Japanese, Asian, and putatively universal notions of law during the 1920s. While reconsidering underlying assumptions in the study of professions about the importance of science, merit, and privilege, the papers analyze professional change in imperial Japan through its local and global connections.
